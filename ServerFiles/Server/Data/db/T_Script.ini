101|Limestone Mtn.|Sec 1: Awakening|You were found sleeping peacefully in a large blue crystal in the mine near Andrew Village. The discovery surprised everyone! 
 
When you woke up, you realized you were staying in a lovely village. However, you'd lost your memory. You tried to talk with the villagers as much as possible, hoping to remember your past.
|You helped the villagers defeat the lethal Mushroids. During the battle, you found a blue crystal. Laz, the Mining Captain suggested you to go back to the mine where you were found and take the blue crystal with you.

However, a demonic creature waited for you in the mine. After a fierce battle, you killed it. Unfortunately, you still had no memory of your past. This was just the beginning. 
|
102|Limestone Mtn.|Sec 2: Crystal Clue|Miner Airy believed the demons you had killed in the mine were summoned for the sole purpose of murdering you. He crinkled his brow, concerned, and suggested that you give the shards of Blue Crystal to Zumi Merchant Alec. He might be able to find out something by identifying the crystal shards. 
 
However, Alec had some problems of his own...
|A Long Horn Yak stole the tool Merchant Alec used to identify crystals. You helped get it back for him.
 
Determining the crystal's make-up would take some time, so Merchant Alec asked you to deliver a report while you waited. On the way, you heard that an old mine in the South was in trouble.
|
103|Limestone Mtn.|Sec 3: Oracle Magi|You finally got the results of Alec's analysis of the blue crystal shards. Strangely, nothing appeared special about it. Alec told you common instruments couldn't test the magic composition of the blue crystal.



You were told to ask Oracle Magi Athena Marie, who lived by the waterwheel, for help. However, you were warned she could seem cold and indifferent. 
|It took a long time to get to the waterwheel. Surprisingly, Oracle Magi Athena Marie was waiting for you. She hinted that you might be an Eternal Guardian.
 
The Eternal Guardians were the children of Gods, born from blue crystals, tasked with building a legendary paradise. Unfortunately, that was the extent of the knowledge of the villagers. You had to head to a larger town for more information.
|
104|Limestone Mtn.|Sec 4: Angor Quarry| Mining Mushroid King and Limestone Golems occupied the Angor Quarry, causing toxic fungi to overwhelm Limestone Mtn.

The quarry was in ruins. Mining Captain Kev ordered all work to stop. Before he resorted to asking outside towns for help, he hoped you could gather some information about what was going on inside the mine.
|You defeated the giant monsters in the quarry, thus solving Limestone Mtn.'s dilemma. Overjoyed, the villagers believed you to have legendary abilities. 
 
It was time to start a new trip. You needed to get back your memory and fulfill your destiny. Thus, you went to Seabell in Tranquil Hill. You had a feeling the next piece of the puzzle could be there! 
|
105|Tranquil Hill|Sec 1: Seabell|You met a kind-hearted guard called Policeman Bamen. He talked on and on about the town. Unexpectedly, roiling underneath the seemingly peaceful town were lots of problems waiting to be solved.


You can either try to help the police by killing Angelly or try your hand at patrol quests. These quests will help you find out more about the people here and allow you to gather information. 
|Policeman Bamen introduced Police Chief Rolf to you. He acted aloof toward you. Even though you helped him complete quests, he continued to give you the cold shoulder. 
 
You met the Seabell Mayor, Spence, in a quest. He told you that he knew you were doing the policemen's work. Spence wondered what the police captain did all day. He certainly wasn't working!
|
106|Tranquil Hill|Sec 2: The Eagle Gang| Eagle Gang Robbers plagued the town. They behaved so brashly that even local policemen were scared of them!

Merchant Abel, a victim of the robbers, believed that a master villain was behind the Eagle Gang pulling the strings. He hired you to investigate. You started the job by getting a secret letter from the robbers.
|You got the secret letter. Surprisingly, you discovered that Police Chief Rolf wrote it! 
 
Merchant Abel hoped you wouldn't do anything to frighten them away before you got ironclad proof. You fought the robbers and found an Antique Sword belonging to Abel's friend, Ranch Owner Brock.
|
107|Tranquil Hill|Sec 3: Fort Verdure|To defeat Eagle Gang Robbers, Ranch Owner Brock decided to take up his sword again. You were asked to help him defeat the Robbers.

You set out from two different directions. Ranch Owner Brock managed to attract the Robbers' attention, while your task was to destroy their base camp, Fort Verdure.
|You fought along the way and reached Fort Verdure. You managed to kill Eagle Gang Leader Ketak. The notorious group collapsed after this devastating blow. 
 
 Eagle Gang Camp Leader Boswell's pocket watch was given to him by Police Chief Rolf as a gift, thus tying the corrupt chief to the criminals. Peace and harmony returned to the village. The villagers expressed their gratitude to you.
|
108|Rainbowfall Forest|Sec 1: The Village Secret|The Anuran in Rainbowfall Forest lived peacefully in the small town of Opera.

You made friends with many of the Anuran. Gradually, you realized that the Dark Marsh Group caused them great distress.
|The village fought against the Dark Marsh Group. Years ago, Villager Warrior Del took in a boy named Juan, who planned steal the secrets of the village. He was now leader of Dark Marsh Group, and he planned an invasion. He sent a spy to the village to steal further secrets.
 
To avoid letting the village's secret be known by outsiders, you killed the enemy spy. 
|
109|Rainbowfall Forest|Sec 2: Prismata|The strange things that had happened at Prismata threw the entire forest into a state of heightened anxiety. You asked the villagers for more information. 
 
Wizard Smack said the phenomenon was related to the paranormal force of the Rainbow Gem. You didn't understand what this meant, but you believed that the magic gem had something to do with the blue crystal in which you were born.
|In the forest, you saved some explorers who were attacked by the Dark Marsh Group. Recently, the animals living in Prismata had become more and more irritable. After investigating, you found out that the Dark Marsh Group planned to lead the turtle army to attack the village. 
 
Before they carried out the plan, you found Trainer Clooney and killed him, thus ending the assault.
|
110|Rainbowfall Forest|Sec 3: The Dark Marsh|Teenage Frog Sib told you the town's mission: Opera must guard the Rainbowfall Forest. You wondered if the crystal stick protected by generations of the Anrian family had some connection with the Rainbow Gem.

Meanwhile, something was happening in Bicid Bog. You seized the opportunity to slip in and investigate Lixy, the injured town warrior.
|Dark Marsh Traitor Grey Tongue caused a disturbance by escaping from the group. After you helped him defeat the Dark Marsh Lieutenant, he told you Juan's plot. 
 
Juan planned to divine the location of the Rainbow Gem with the Prism Socket. If he obtained the Rainbow Gem, he would be invincible. To stop him, Grey Tongue fled the camp with the socket and asked you to take it back to the village.
|
111|Rainbowfall Forest|Sec 4: Tasos Channel|With the stolen files from Opera, Dark Marsh Leader Juan found the Prism Socket. He then combined it with the crystal stick from the Anrian family, forming a key that showed the exact location of Rainbow Gem.

Villager Warrior Del went to the Ancient Aqueduct alone to stop Juan. Teenage Frog Sib fretted about him and asked you to assist him.
|Gang members attacked Villager Warrior Del, injuring him, and Juan took the Rainbow Key. You were their last hope. 
 
You managed to stop Juan in the Tasos Channel and take back the key. The key lost its power, turning into a normal crystal stick. The Rainbow Gem restored its energy. You saved the forest, but the Rainbow Gem had nothing to do with the blue crystal. You'd have to look further.
|
112|Goss Mountains|Sec 1: Goss Mountains|The Mayor of Cenana, Pierce, was from the Zumi. Days ago, in a deep well, an old nut was found. Believing this was a sign of ancient ruins beneath their feet, the villagers started exploration underground.

Monsters attacked the exploration team. Many were injured. Concurrently, the village guards met some trouble.
|After defeating a group of pumas and gathering materials used to make armor, you gained the trust of the villagers. 
 
Geologist Ash studied the stones obtained from Goss Stone Demons. She believed the stones had a magnetic force made by an old civilization. She asked you to take them to the strange Inventor Nikola, her ex-boyfriend, for data analysis.
|
113|Goss Mountains|Sec 2: Lost Civilization|To analyze the stone accurately, Inventor Nikola asked you to gather some materials that would improve the performance of the Core Analyzer.

He looked rather excited to be involved in this discovery. This was a rare link to the old civilizations of the world.
|It took you awhile to get the cargo back from the monsters for the merchants. You also had to gather materials used to make oil. With your help, Inventor Nikola completed his data analysis. He hoped to win back Geologist Ash's love by helping her. 
 
You told Ash and Mayor Pierce the good news, but it saddened Ash to hear that work absorbed every facet of Nikola's life. 
|
114|Goss Mountains|Sec 3: Shale Cavern|Though Mayor Pierce argued a lot with Nikola, he started worrying when he heard Nikola went to the Shale Cavern for research. 

He asked you to go protect Nikola, even though a small part of him hoped something bad would happen to him.
|Huge robots inhabited the Shale Cavern. After defeating them, you consulted with Inventor Nikola, who had just completed his robot with the help of an ancient formula. 
 
Nikola showed his robot to Mayor Pierce; the creation angered Pierce greatly. He blamed Geologist Ash, saying she pushed Nikola to waste time and materials. A new rivalry began...
|
115|Goss Mountains|Sec 4: Dragon's Keep|The Golden Claw also troubled Cenana. They were scheming to get a treasure hidden near the town, which caused ripples of panic among the villagers. 

Ursun Blacksmith Bryson planned to make armor and weapons that would help her brother defeat the Golden Claw. She asked for your assistance.
|What you did for Ursun Blacksmith Bryson touched Garrison Captain Shears's heart. After investigating, you found the treasure Golden Claw sought. A sleeping dragon guarded it. Going after the treasure might wake the dragon and bring danger to the village. 
 
Shears decided to defeat them by himself, but first, he wanted you to go to the den and investigate the Leader of the Golden Claw, Salvio.
|
116|Goss Mountains|Sec 5: Eroda|Garrison Captain Shears was about to challenge the Golden Claw. Before he did so, he told you to ask Monster Hunter Evans for assistance. Evans had defeated a giant dragon before.

However, the challenge was not as simple as Shears thought...
|Monster Hunter Evans believed the battle would awaken the evil dragon. He was right. The sleeping beast  woke with a bone chilling roar. 
 
Garrison Captain Shears escaped and returned to the village. You were left in the large den, facing the dragon. You had to fight. After a brutal battle, you managed to kill the dragon.
|
117|Beluga Bay|Sec 1: Harbor Affairs|Before the pirates arrived, Beluga Harbor was  a prosperous place. However, it had become harder and harder to do business there.

However, what worried Architect Angul most was not pirates, but the Angelly, whose slime corroded the defense wall. Thus, he asked you to clear away the Angelly monsters.
|You slaughtered the Angelly and solved the robbery issues, but your problems were far from over. You witnessed a pirate attack on Ursun Trader Webber's ship. Clearly, pirates were still a big issue here. 
 
You were asked to kill the Eagle Gang Leader who led the Eagle Gang to attack the town. After completing this task easily, Harbor Town Mayor Dominic recruited you for further help. |
118|Beluga Bay|Sec 2: Deadly Love|The pirates annoyed Harbor Town Mayor Dominic, but something else weighed on his conscience.



Garrison Sniper Nelle told you a story about a girl who saved a man from the sea, then fell in love with him. You talked to Harbor Town Mayor Dominic, hoping he might know more about it.
|The girl in the tale was Mayor Dominic's daughter, and the man was Ulicul, a pirate. She lost consciousness after Ulicul tricked her into drinking a potion. Ulicul transformed into an Ogre and escaped. In a den in Scalen Woods, you found Ogre footprints. 
 
Before the guard team began the hunt for the Ogre, they introduced you to Lady 
Barb, who wanted Mayor Dominic to fall in love with her.
|
119|Beluga Bay|Sec 3: Morticora|While searching for Pirate Spy Ulicul, the guard team accidentally found Imps living in the Morticora. The Imps were provoked by the pirates and prepared to attack Beluga Harbor.



They had to stop them! While the guard team was busy fighting against pirates, Garrison Captain Strall asked you to go into the Skeleton Burrow and find Ulicul.
|You killed the Imps and defeated Wild Ogre Ulicul. You retrieved the designs of the town wall defenses, but Mayor Dominic was not soothed. He wanted to awaken his daughter, but he did not want her to know of Ulicul's death.
 
Architect Angul found out that the design of the town wall defense had been copied by someone. That copy might fall into the hands of the pirates!
|
120|Beluga Bay|Sec 4: Pirate Battle|You proved yourself by completing the quest perfectly. Garrison Captain Strall would like to give you some more important tasks. He asked you to meet Garrison Scout Rothy and Pirate Arvil near the Vileshark HQ.

He warned you that they did not readily trust others. In such a dangerous place, you had to prove yourself.
|Garrison Scout Rothy and Pirate Arvil trusted you and shared their information. While the Vileshark leaders busied themselves at a meeting, you destroyed their powder system and slayed pirates. 
 
You then defeated the Vileshark Leader Gilbert and retrieved the copy of the design. But there wasn't time to celebrate; you would soon have to battle the Vilesharks.
|
121|Beluga Bay|Sec 5: Vileshark Headquarters|Garrison Scout Rothy was thrilled to get the note. He started to read it immediately, but as soon as he finished, it burst into flames! It was time to launch an attack on the pirates with the town citizens' help.

Meanwhile, someone saw Spy Pirate Arvil's secret but didn't make it known publicly. How peculiar - were they biding their time?
|It was Pirate Spy Ulicul who saw through Arvil's secret identity, but he didn't tell anyone. Thus, she remained safe. After you defeated him, Spy Ulicul decided to go straight and help Arvil. 
 
The guard team forced the elite pirates out of their base camp while you and some brave young men launched an assault and killed the three Vileshark leaders.|
122|Wetlands|Sec 1: City in the Bog|Explorers were drawn to the places where the catastrophes had happened. It was said that a magic city lay hidden in the old bog.

No one had found the city yet. Most of the adventurers fainted due to the poison released by bog mushrooms. Hence, they had to stop their search and try to find an antidote.
|With your help, researchers started to work on an antidote. Complicated analysis and preparations took lots of time and delayed the exploration. 
 
This concerned the sponsor. The people in the camp despaired. At this time, you brought back a huge magic rootstalk. Your contribution boosted the expedition's morale greatly.
|
123|Wetlands|Sec 2: Magic Water Source|With your help, Researcher Merida made breakthrough progress on her research and made a discovery about the water quality of the bog.

Researcher Merida believed all the problems were caused by the source of the water, located at the side of a giant tree to the south. She asked you to go there and investigate.
|Under the instruction of Researcher Merida, you reached the Branda Root, a giant tree to the south. Wetlands Frog Elea told you that the tree grew by a magic spring. 
 
After searching, you found the source of the evil magic was <Real Terminator> Acilino. After a tough fight, you managed to kill him. Elea gave you an old sigil that symbolized the protector of the Branda Root.
|
124|Wetlands|Sec 3: Branda Root|After you killed the ancient demon, all the living things in the bog panicked. Unexpectedly, branches and leaves in Branda Root began falling.

The protector of Branda Root would have more insight into the situation, so you went to question him.
|From Wetlands Frog Elea, you learned the demon you killed was just a shadow. The real one had already escaped to the depths of Branda Root. 
 
The demon absorbed all the magic energy of Branda Root. Now even the greatest mage could not compete with him. Slipping into Branda Root and killing him before he was completely revived seemed like the only chance to defeat him.
|
125|Wetlands|Sec 4: Clues|You met the Pharmacist Mort, who told you that   the air to the northwest was heavy with non-poisonous magic particles.

Rare plants grew there, living on the magic particles. Pharmacist Mort asked you to scrape some moss off the shells of the Aqua Draco Turtles found in the magic remnant area. In exchange, he would provide some useful information.
|After you completed Pharmacist Mort's quest, he told you a ghost story. Curious, you followed the tale to an old monument. 
 
There you met a forgotten Soul. He asked you to kill Evil Eye King Gino, who had survived after the explosion. After defeating him, you got a key.  You took the key to Researcher Merida, who accidently discovered that the key could be combined with the old sigil.
|
126|Wetlands|Sec 5: Malice Ruins|When everyone thought they had reached a dead end, you brought forth the key to open the gate of the Malice Ruins.

The expedition dug out an old crooked staff. Researcher Merida believed it could be used to combine the key with the old sigil. She asked you to get the staff from Antique Collector Bes.
|Researcher Merida told you about the explosion. A Mage cast a spell that went awry, causing the blast. Sadly, the Malice Ruins imprisoned the mage's soul.
 
You inserted the key into a  hole on the Monument, and the Malice Ruins appeared. You released the mage's soul at last. You then returned the golden scepter to Antique Collector Bes and were named a master explorer!
|
127|Valley of Kings|Sec 1: The Valley|The Garden had a holy mission: to guard and protect the Ulta Hall. They have served as defenders for generations. 

However, the nearby Remain Creatures, who were born to protect the Ulta Hall, went mad and attacked travelers. The timid Gladiator Derek was tasked by the Village Elder with investigating the Remain Creatures. He quaked a bit thinking about his mission.
|You helped Gladiator Derek complete the quest. You also met two village elders and other gladiators.  
 
 
Village Elder Jott, who disliked outsiders, had come to trust you. He asked you to participate in the fighter examination.You managed to get the Carmela's Scheme. You also killed the Zumi brothers, who were planning to dig a tunnel to Ulta Hall. You were promoted to  fighter status.
|
128|Valley of Kings|Sec 2: The Unknown Poison|You talked with Alchemist Jenna in the village, who informed you that the southwest was suffering from swarms of toxic bugs. Hence, Alchemist Jenna asked you to go to the bug cave and kill the insects.

Alchemist Jenna eagerly hoped that after killing the bugs, you could bring her some of their chitinous shedding, an ideal material for alchemy.
|Alchemist Jenna believed there would be a bug queen hiding nearby. You had to stop her before more of the toxic insects hatched. 
 
Village Elder Angi and Herbs Merchant Phil collaborated on a plan to kill the queen bug. You used a wreath trap and successfully slayed her. Angi recommended you for Village Guardian. Village Elder Jott agreed.
|
129|Valley of Kings|Sec 3: Rotten|Everyone believed the bug problem had been solved, but Village Elder Angi found that even though the queen died, the population of insects continued to grow.

The disaster spiraled out of her control. She hoped you could report this issue to Village Grand Elder Gray and ask him for help.
|The Village Grand Elder Gray believed the plague was not a natural disaster. You followed his instructions to get the halo gem and reach the deepest depths of Rotten. 
 
The villain behind the disaster appeared. The two of you battled, and you triumphed, slaughtering him. The bug disaster ended at last. 
|
130|Valley of Kings|Sec 4: Bewitched Shells|Warrior Erth planned an assault on the Carmela Gang, but the wound on his chest weakened him. He couldn't carry out his plot.

Warrior Erth found the shell of Carmela Leader, Snap Turtle Gamera. The shell was harder than an ordinary one; the village warriors could not craft anything quite so tough. He asked you to bring carapaces back to him to study.
|You snuck into the Carmela Camp and brought him the  back plates from elite Carmela Fighters. Village Elder Angi found some dark inscriptions on the carapaces. 
 
Elders wanted you to kill Carmela vice Officer Gador, who had cast the forbidden spells. You did so with little effort. With the recommendation of the two elders, you were awarded the title of Village Protector.|
131|Valley of Kings|Sec 5: Ulta Hall|Ancient spirits shook the Earth to warn Village Grand Elder Gray that the Carmela had completed the tunnel to the Ulta Hall in an attempt to get swords. The Earth Spirits would destroy the mountain if they did not stop.

Village Grand Elder Gray reported the situation to the Church and asked you to work with Warrior Erth to stop the Carmela and pacify the Earth Spirits.
|You killed Carmela Supervisor Kenny, but Warrior Erth and his team were ambushed. He lost all the warriors and was also severely injured. 
 
The Carmela seized the opportunity to absorb energy from the holy swords. Warrior Erth used Ancient Giant Dragon King George's soul to help him fight Carmela Leader Snap Turtle Gamera. You joined the fray and defeated him.
|
132|Avila Volcano|Sec 1: Volcanic Ecology|You reached the Avila Volcano, but you were not welcomed in the Loto.

Later, the Mayor's Wife Henny stopped you and asked you to prove your strength by killing the Vorts outside the village.
|Loto had little food or medical supplies. You gathered turtle meat and Spiky Fruit for the Mayor's Wife, Henny. As you gathered supplies, you found the Mayor of Loto's lost necklace and ring. 
 
You accepted Tuskar Hero Vort's task and ventured into the forest to kill the Spike Forest King Lalo. What you had done for Loto made the villagers respect you.
|
133|Avila Volcano|Sec 2: Ebaster's Flames |It was said that common weapons were useless against Ebaster. What's more, the dangerous flames encircling Ebaster were quite deadly.

Therefore, Blacksmith Bach asked you to gather some Geothermal Coal to improve the heat of the furnace. Bach then forged a set of armor that could withstand Ebaster's flame. The villagers had their hopes rididng on Tusker Hero Vort.
|Per Blacksmith Bach's request, you carried Geothermal Coal to Geothermal Researcher Kelt for processing. He asked you to bring him some materials for research before he began.
 
You went back to Bach, who told you that the carapace of a Lava Turtle could make an ideal fire resistant shield. To defeat the flame of Ebaster, you would need a carapace shield made from the Turtle Crawler King.
|
134|Avila Volcano|Sec 3: Baram's Chasm|Though everything went well, Geothermal Researcher Iena paced anxiously. She explained that in the depths of Baram's Chasm, there was a crystal that generated enough energy to create a volcano.

The report from Geothermal Researcher Iena showed the power of this crystal was inexplicably running wild. Geothermal Researcher Iena decided to ask Wizard Raist for help. 
|Before the power of the Flame Crystal faded away completely, you were asked to put three totems from Wizard Raist at three different locations. 
 
Geothermal Researcher Iena asked you to bring the crystal to Tuskar Hero Vort to help fight against Ebaster. Once he touched the crystal, a burst of energy flowed into his body.
|
135|Avila Volcano|Sec 4: Stop the Zealots|The temporary peace didn't last long. The Zealots planned something devious. Prisoner Imp Chemm gave a sinister, knowing smile. No matter how much Tusker Hero Vort interrogated him, he refused to speak.

An idea struck Tusker Hero Vort. He brought the disembodied head of another Imp to scare Chemm. The Imp was so frightened that he finally told Vort some useful information...
|The plan worked. Finally, Prisoner Imp Chemm told Tuskar Hero Vort about the plan to blow up Baltaroi. Tuskar Hero Vort asked you to destroy the explosives at the Rasys. 
 
Among the Zealots, you came across Zealot Believer Belar attempting to escape. He told you that priests had begun to summon Ebaster. Even if you killed the priests, you could not stop Ebaster from coming.
|
136|Avila Volcano|Sec 5: Baltaroi Core|Ebaster made the battle almot impossible for Tusker Hero Vort. The flames surrounding Ebaster proved invincible. No one could defeat them.

While everyone battled against Ebaster, Tusker Hero Vort slipped into the prison. He knew Chemm was starving, so he planned to use food as bait to get some information.
|Prisoner Imp Chemm took the bait and told Tuskar Hero Vort how to kill Ebaster. He must kill the priests of Ebaster, then obtain and consume a fire-ward potion from the Zealot Witch, Alonzo.  
 
But the fire-ward potion was a trick. It weakened Tuskar Hero Vort; he was too frail to fight. You had to take his place and kill the Ebastr. After a difficult fight, you prevailed.
|
137|Golden Plains|Sec 1: City of Prosperity|Wealthy Merchant Samrod from Golden City offered you a job as mercenary. It wasn't as complicated as it sounded.

Samrod got an order for some medicinal materials from the Thorners outside Golden City. The quest seemed fairly simple.  Perhaps he was testing you. 
|You brought Wealthy Merchant Samrod the required materials. Samrod, impressed, recommended that you work for the government officers. 
 
Meanwhile, Wealthy Merchant Samrod felt that the bug disaster in the south might come to Golden City. He asked you to kill the bug king to prevent further chaos.
|
138|Golden Plains|Sec 2: A Mayor's Slumber|Wealthy Merchant Samrod fretted over the mayor, his old friend. The mayor slept for days and left mountains of paperwork unfinished.

Wealthy Merchant Samrod asked you to talk with Secretary Kitia and determine a way to wake up Golden City Mayor Kandar.
|Mayor's Secretary Kitia asked you to relate the situation to Oracle Alchemist Emi. Emi would only help if you found Ranch Owner Ryen's wife's missing necklace. 
 
You found the necklace and brought it to Ryen. He explained that a curse caused the mayor to fall fast asleep. Emi gave you a magic orb; you used it to defeat the ghost who trapped the mayor in his dream.
|
139|Golden Plains|Sec 3: The Mayor's Dream|Everyone thought Golden City Mayor Kandar would wake up after the ghost had been killed.

However, the mayor could not be roused. The Mayor's Secretary Kitia sent you to ask Oracle Alchemist Emi if there was some other way to wake him up.
|Emi gave you a magic necklace. You followed her instructions and put it around the mayor's neck. A magic power instantly sent you into the mayor's dream. 
 
You met the mayor in his dream; he informed you that a ghost was at the root of the dilemma. You defeated the ghost and came back to reality. The mayor woke up at last.
|
140|Golden Plains|Sec 4: The Wolfeye Gang|Rumor had it that the police in Golden City were practically useless. They loafed around town all day and never helped anyone.

Police Chief Rolf beared the burden of the townspeople's disdain. He hoped that one day, the police could regain the citizens' trust. Hence, he asked you to weaken the strength of the Wolfeye Gang.
|The Police Captain said that Ranch Owner Ryen might know something about the Wolfeye Bandits. Before he helped you, Ryen wanted you to send a secret letter to his old friend, Ursun Warrior Banestu.  
 
After you delivered the letter to Banestu, he gave you a message for Ryen. Ryen was angry when he got the investigation results. He decided to teach the Wolfeyes a lesson.
|
141|Golden Plains|Sec 5: Sanity's Ascent|You helped Golden City citizens kill lots of Wolfeye members. This angered Wolfeye Advisor Chino. He decided to launch a large-scale assault on Golden City for revenge.

Ursun Warrior Banestu was an honest creature. He copied the battle plan and secretly gave it to Ranch Owner Ryen, who brought the plan to light. 
|The Wolfeye Gang's long-distance cannon could wipe out the entire town. But only No.1 Advisor Hans knew how to use it. You attacked him. When Wolfeye Advisor Chino learned that the cannon attack failed, he ordered beast masters to  attack the town. 
 
Chino didn't expect that his elite army would be defeated by you. When he learned his men were dead, he immediately withdrew the remaining troops.
|
142|Arid Wilds|Sec 1: Boulder|You met Miner Mack on the way. He told you that in the sands lived thieves who attacked travelers.

They even slipped into the town and stole from the villagers. Mack asked you to defeat the thieves.
|You took the crystal ore to Miner Mack. He asked you to bring it to Miner Merchant Ads. After getting the ore, Ads signed the trading contract with Mayor of Boulder Terra and Mining Captain Brent. 
 
Terra explained that stone monsters had been appearing in the village since Brent dug out the red crystal. The monsters attacked regularly. Terra asked you to kill the leader.
|
143|Arid Wilds|Sec 2: Beasts and Worms|The disturbance in Veraldar concerned Village Elder Roland greatly. Roland told you the entire story. It seemed the issue stemmed from the discovery of the red crystal a few days ago.

To protect the village from Winged Wolfmen, the elder asked you to drive them off and buy time for the villagers.
|Biologist Clif analyzed the Winged Wolfman Leader's teeth and found that Winged Wolfmen lived on Sand Storm Worms. These insects contained a toxin that had the power to drive living things crazy. 
 
Great Magician Render believed the Bane Prince had unlocked the Slain. If they could not stop the child, it would bring disaster to all living beings.
|
144|Arid Wilds|Sec 3: Slain|Great Magician Render planned to stop the insects by shutting down the opening to the Slain. However, she was not strong enough to do it by herself.

She suddenly remembered that Elder Roland's totem could repair the rift and seal the Slain.
|Unluckily, desert thieves stole the Sand God Totem. Meanwhile, Boulder Guild Darr was captured while spying on their camp. 
 
You slipped into the desert thieves' camp and snatched the Sand God Totem. The Great Magician Render imbued the totem with magical powers. You took it to Slain. After the bug queen was killed, you sealed the Slain with the energized totem.
|
145|Arid Wilds|Sec 4:  Imprisoned|At the village meeting, the Chief and Elders insisted that they would not to send the guards to crusade against desert bandits. 

Village Elder Roland told you that Guild Captain Darr was the husband of Tarasha. Desert bandits captured him during a mission with Garrison Soldier Cerris. However, Cerris mentioned nothing about it when he came back to village.
|You went to the desert thieves' Camp and found the imprisoned Darr. Magic enchantments prevented you from freeing him. Darr said the desert thief chief and the Bane Prince planned to break into the Dianack. 
 
At the Dianack, Earth Spirit Elder said that the Bane Prince controlled most of Amur's Souls. You helped Earth Spirit Elder get back the Amur Mind Stone.
|
146|Arid Wilds|Sec 5: Dianack|The Earth Spirit Elder sensed that Great Magician Render had incredible magical power. Thus, he asked you to take the Amur Mind Stone to Great Magician Render.

The Earth Spirit Elder believed Great Magician Render's power could stop Amur's raging souls and help get everything back to normal.
|You took the Amur Mind Stone to Great Magician Render. He furrowed his brow, telling you that the Bane Prince planned to control Amur's Souls and create his own terrible army. 
 
You entered the Baira's Chamber anxiously. The Amur King, clearly controlled by outside powers, attacked you. Finally, you defeated Amur's Souls and brought the Amur Mind Stone to Great Magician Render.
|
147|Delphi Forest|Sec 1: Forest Dangers|Upon entering the Delphi Forest, Garrison Captain Vien warned you that the forest was in danger; he suggested you leave as soon as possible.

Garrison Captain Vien told you an attack on the forest was taking place. The Empire hired the Ketak Ogres to cut trees down and drive villagers away from the forest.
|You drove away the beasts for Garrison Captain Vien. The village was out of danger for now. However, many villagers were unconscious due to toxic particles spread by the beasts.

|
154|Blackflame Peak|Sec 2: The Unique Mineral|Black Iron Clerk Hernado had many orders to complete. The Black Iron Union, a symbol of strength of the town, would be in danger of bankruptcy if he couldn't complete the orders on time.



Because of the influx of villainous activity in the mine, the village was short on the materials needed to forge items for the orders. No one dared enter. Hernando hoped you could bring Stragga Ore to him.
|You managed to bring back Stragga Ore. Other materials were needed, so you returned to the mine and brought back cobalt crystals and other items. Blacksmith Pepper refined the crude Straya Alloy.

|The village chief told you that Alchemist Tono had a way to test water quality. You brought some samples of water and related materials to Tono. After analyzing the items, he found Wizard King Wushu magic. 
 
To make sure Wushu poison was the cause, you were asked to bring the Heart of Moss for Wizard Lutelian. Wizard Lutelian determined the Wrathbone Tribe was behind the contamination.
|
160|Decay Swamp|Sec 2:  Pure Water|Rose Knight Shyos, who did not believe in ghosts and evil spirits, analyzed the information provided by the Knights of the Rose. He believed the Old Draco Turtle in Tainted Bog belonged to Empire's Mercenaries.

Rose Knight Shyos insisted that supernatural powers did not exist; this made him unwelcome in the village. He hoped you could help him get this report to Wizard Lutelian.
|Wizard Lutelian suggested that you investigate nearby Soulmor Falls. You found a broken badge from a route defender, proving that Empire's Mercenaries broke into Soulmor Falls. 
 
To help Wizard Lutelian purify the water, you took the stempump and a charm from Trader Trisban to Rose Knight Shyos. Wizard Lutelian hoped Shyos could bring back Wushu tainted water samples and purified water.

|You checked a schedule scroll you got from one of the Empire's Mercenaries. You learned the Wrathbone Tribe planned to poison all the villagers and control Galt as their puppet. 
 
Wizard Lutelian discovered the dark energy that had been cast into Vortek came from the evil totems in the tribe. You had to go to the Wrathbone Tribe, destroy the totems, and dispatch the Darksong Witch Ace.
|
163|Decay Swamp|Sec 5: Galt's Bedroom|Wizard Lutelian sincerely believed King of Earth Galt had been affected by the evil energy. His anger would be out of control very soon. He hoped you would go to Galt's Bedroom and stop the disaster.

He hoped that you could tell Ranch Owner Nick's Wife, Auntie Solsa, about the current situation. He believed that Auntie Solsa could help the Union Army prepare. They could not lose.
|Basel Border was a natural barrier. The only way to get there was by magic teleport, but that required preparation and time. Auntie Solsa asked for help from Oracle Fae Tailest and Archaeologist Polos.

But as they were about to return to their base with this crucial intelligence, they were set upon by a Toroto fighter.|They managed to overcome the fighter, and while Andele wanted to kill him, Rachy stood in his way. Andele began to resent Rachy because of it, but his irritation was soothed by the renown he received from bringing back such critical intelligence.

252|Legend of Sage|Sec 1: Shadower's Request|The Shadowers, a group of scholars from around the world who aim to protect ancient knowledge, recently gathered in Aven. They are protective of their strong faith and possess the power of the holy light. 

They surfaced because they encountered a problem they could not solve. Zephyrinus asked the Eternal Guardians to find Shadow Guardian Hillem, who seeks help. |After learning what happened to the Shadowers, the Eternal Guardian realized that their foes, the Dark Bloods, stole their precious Saint Orb. The Dark Bloods planned to use the orb to travel back in time and kill the founder of the Shadowers, Sage King Gaimaizz. 

The Eternal Guardian, aware of this scheme, traveled to the past to stop <Dark Blood Blade> Finn; however, the Saint Orb was destroyed during the battle. 

While in the past, the Eternal Guardian noticed some discrepancies between the truth and the story the Shadowers propagated. |
253|Legend of Sage|Sec 2: The Truth|After the danger to the Shadowers passed, Hillem remembered the words of his late king; Gaimaizz foretold of a prophet who would resolve the conflict between the Shadowers and Dark Bloods. He believed the Eternal Guardian could be that sage and encouraged the Guardian to undertake the trial of sage.

He explained that a sage is a guardian who wears armor covered with sacred inscriptions and wields a Hammer of Holy Light. He guided the Eternal Guardian toward the trial.|The Eternal Guardian gradually learned more about the conflict between the two tribes and realized it was all a grave misunderstanding.

The Sage King killed all the Dark Bloods because they were about to be demonized. The leader of the Dark Bloods, the Sage King's dear friend, did not want his people to suffer, but he could not bear to kill them himself.

During the trial, the Eternal Guardian witnessed the determination of the Sage King as well as his guilt over the decision.|
254|Legend of Sage|Sec 3: Sage Trial|Hillem explained that it was time for the last stage of the Sage's Trial. The Eternal Guardian would have to face off against the Sage King to prove he or she qualified for the title.

255|Death Valley|Sec 1: Dust Crisis|The Drakai who reside in Death Valley feared something happened to their beloved shaman. When they appealed to the spirits to help them, their pleas were not answered; where had the Holy Spirit gone?

Athena Marie told the Eternal Guardian about the disppearance of the Holy Spirit. The Curia was not taking it lightly; they sent the Shadowers to help resolve the situation. Athena Marie asked the Eternal Guardian to find out more information from Divine Warrior Captain Onissem. |The Eternal Guardian discovered that the Drakai in Death Valley had divided into two feuding groups: the benevolent Dust Tribe, led by Chief Toecker, and the evil Vilebranch Tribe, led by Toecker's brother, <Vilebranch Chief> Giggs. The Vilebranch Tribe schemed to control the Holy Spirit.

Toecker did not want to attack his own brother. While the Shadowers and the Eternal Guardian sought to free the Holy Spirit, <Black Marsh Spirit> Kal flew into a rage. The Eternal Guardian killed Kal, but unfortunately, the situation was only getting worse.|
256|Death Valley|Sec 2: Revenge on Ire's Eye|After seeing Kal's pain, Toecker realized that the Vilebranch Tribe had already done major harm to the Holy Spirit. He decided he couldn't let his brother do any more damage. He asked the Eternal Guardian to find Shadow Guardian Lonesaw and help attack Ire's Eye Camp. 

Lonesaw's team consisted of shamans from the Dust Tribe and Shadowers who were separated with their families after a previous attack on Ire's Eye. The group had abundant information on the camp and was eager to attack it.|With the help of Vilebranch Warrior Ornen, who was saved by Lonesaw and subsequently realized the error of his ways, the Shadowers found a way to free Shawnba with an Evil Branch Totem. The Eternal Guardian intended to lure the Drakai out of the campground while Guardian Risshin rescued the Shawnba.

Unfortunately, Risshin's plan failed; <Vilebranch Chief> Giggs snatched away the totem, then used it to extract Shawnba's power. Risshin asked the Eternal Guardian to take down Giggs, and after a long and difficult battle, the Guardian killed Giggs.|
257|Death Valley|Sec 3: Gristle Prison|During Vilebranch's ambush of Ire's Eye Camp, the Great Shaman Stedlow went missing. Knight Captain Ingengtai told the Eternal Guardians that he knew the whereabouts of Stedlow; he believed the Toroto Empire had kidnapped the shaman and taken him to a lab where they planned to experiment on him and extract his power.

Ingengtai teleported the Eternal Guardians to the lab inside the Toroto Empire, and they began their search for the shaman. |The Eternal Guardian killed Stedlow's kidnapper and saved the shaman, who mentioned that his power had been extracted for military purposes. Stedlow asked the Eternal Guardian to slay the Experimental Beast and Experimental Weapon who had absorbed his powers. 

After the Eternal Guardians defeated the wicked beasts, Stedlow regained his powers and returned to Death Valley. He asked the Eternal Guardian to encourage the Dust Tribe to have faith; they could still save the Holy Spirit.|
258|Death Valley|Sec 4: Holy Returns|The operation came to an end as the Eternal Guardian killed <Vilebranch Chief> Giggs and freed Shawnba. Meanwhile, the team searching for the force corroding the Dust Tribe's power made some intriguing discoveries.

The search team, led by Soul Walker Skol and Shadow Master Oldettia, found a strange source of energy inside Greyview Hollow. Shadow Guardian Lonesaw asked the Eternal Guadian to go to Greyview Hollow to gather more information.|Oldettia told the Eternal Guardian that  <Hollow King> Antor was behind recent strange occurrences; he wanted to extract the Holy Spirit's power and use it to awaken evil spirits in Death Valley.

To stop Antor's sinister ceremony, the Eternal Guardian slayed the demon summoned by Antor and the <Abyss Angel Statue> 
Moa inside Greyview Hollow. The Eternal Guardian also faced possessed <Enslaved Spirit> Quyion and was forced to kill it.

 The Eternal Guardian told Oldettia of Quyion's tragic death. Devastated, Oldettia asked the Guardian to punish Antor.|
259|Death Valley|Sec 5: Guillotine|Both Oldettia and Skol believed a strong force would soon awaken inside Guillotine. Thus, Oldettia asked the Eternal Guardian to go into Guillotine to find Dust Prophet Burinaw, who had disappeared during the search for Antor. 

The Guardian located Burinaw. She explained that the power belonged to <Holy Beast> Gaddis. The beast once used its strength for good, but corrupt people drove it mad, and it began attempting to destroy the human race. Holy Spirits worked to seal it away to avoid future havoc.

Burinaw warned the Eternal Guardian to prepare for an epic battle against Gaddis.|On the way to stop Antor's evil ritual, the Eternal Guardian killed the ceremony's guardian, <Abyss Angel Statue> Moa. The Eternal Guardian then killed Antor himself.

However, the ceremony still had to be stopped; the seal of the King of Holy Spirits had already been broken. Parts of the King of Holy Spirit's soul had leaked into the world, and they had to be gathered together to re-seal the King.

The Eternal Guardian defeated the soul of the King of Holy Spirits and brought it back. Burinaw asked the Eternal Guardian to bring the soul to Oldettia. She promised that the Shadowers would stay in Death Valley to help the Dust Tribe rebuild their home. |

Raven finally discovered the source of the infectious mutations in Eyebloom Plain; she told you to move in whenever you were ready.|
264|Eyebloom Plain|Sec 3: Thornpetal Camp Fights Back|To continue investigating the abnormalities in Eyebloom Plain, the Eternal Guardian followed Raven's directions and left Oiran to meet up with Raven's old friend, a magician named Saqos, by walking downstream alongside the sewer.  

Raven wanted to stop the mutations herself, but she had to stay behind and protect Oiran, so she asked the Guardian to conduct the investigation on her behalf.

Judging by what the Guardian saw in the sewers, Eyebloom Plain didn't have much time. It was time to act quickly.|Down in the sewer, the Guardian met with Raven's old friend, Saqos. The two discussed how to tackle the monster inside Thornpetal Camp.

After defeating a man-made monster, the Eternal Guardian realized that all the abnormalities in Eyebloom Plain were created by a mad scientist named Mustachio.

At last, the Guardian managed to break down the scientist's final defenses and defeat him, thus saving Eyebloom Plain from certain disaster. |

He gave up writing to take care of his daughter. He doted on her every day and loved her more than the sun. This diary was written after Adelle married a man she adored. |Tercet moved back to Eyebloom Plain; he felt that only among the fields of blossoms could his mind truly rest.

The Bane Prince's army of monsters appeared and took over the Rose Temple, a sacred area for the Rose Knights in Tempest Cliff. Using this place as their base in the West, the Bane Prince's army and the pirates in the East surrounded Kalouma.   

Athena Marie hoped the Eternal Guardian could quickly stop the Bane Prince's army of evil from occupying Tempest Cliff. |The Eternal Guardian found Rose Knight Hyluce, who was defeated while protecting the Rose Temple.

Old Captain Untolye offered to help the Eternal Guardian ambush the pirates; he detested them. He also asked the Guardian to bring the Tempest Cliff Meteorological Chart to the man in charge of the operation, Shadow Master Acksay.

After Acksay carefully studied the chart, he drafted a more efficient plan to ambush the pirates and asked the Eternal Guardian to help.|With the help of the Eternal Guardian, the team successfully won back the lighthouse from the dastardly pirates.

Shadow Master Ageash encouraged the Eternal Guardian to lure out <Black Mast Captain> Tinri by holding up the pirates' worst enemy's banner. Killing the pirate captain effectively put an end to the pirates' reign of terror.

The Eternal Guardian stopped in front of the knight, who stood perfectly still, and wondered if it was a statue. Suddenly, a husky voice echoed inside the Eternal Guardian's head. |After talking with the knight, the Eternal Guardian understood his intentions; he had promised to protect Kalouma from the Bane Prince.

However, the knight remembered nothing before his promise. He detested Kalouma, yet he pledged to protect the town with his life. This conflict ate away at the knight.

274|Legend of the Dragon Knight|Sec 1: Legend of the Dragon Knight|You learned from Zephyrinus that a guest from another country sought Curia's help. Curia had assigned two Templar Knights to help her, though from their reports, the outlook was not positive.

Zephyrinus asked you to help the Curia. He wanted you to get a Templar Knight's Token from Amos first, then head to Golden Plains to find Ganne and get an update on the confidential task.|When you arrived at Golden Plains, Ganne told you that Marce was injured and unconscious. Even worse, Kimmy was missing. You searched for her in Opera of Rainbowfall Forest. Based on information from locals, you realized that Kimmy's disappearance was likely not a coincidence.

After collecting the energy of the rainbow crystal, Kimmy asked you to deliver a partial piece of an important document to Ganne. Kimmy had made an important deal with Curia; you knew she was critical to their clandestine plans.|
275|Legend of the Dragon Knight|Sec 2: Mysterious Stone Slate|Though he knew you were running out of time, Ganne still did not want you to leave Kimmy by herself. He asked you to take a hot air balloon to Baram's Chasm to meet with Kimmy after you delivered the document. Pilot Serar took you to your destination.|Since the strong crystal attracts monsters, Kimmy had trouble casting spells to get into Baram's Chasm. It took you two a long time to collect Flame Crystals.

Kimmy examined the last socket in the tablet, unsure what to inlay in it. She asked you to find Librarian Conan, who could translate the ancient transcript and perhaps uncover some clues. Conan revealed that the transcript concerned the legend of Eternal Guardians.

He arranged for you to meet the forensic expert at Andrew V. Mine. The expert explained that the blue crystal was the last item needed to awaken the ancient drake.|

Though the battle was difficult, you managed to defeat him. Bess, who witnessed the fight, feared either you or Kimmy had suddenly become targets. She asked you to deliver the crystal to Conan.

Examining the crystal, Conan explained that people tried to control the ancient drake with spells, but none succeeded. However, the blue crystal was the real key to awakening the drake, and you, as an Eternal Guardian, were just the person for the job.

Suddenly, you saw a vision within the crystal. In it, Kimmy told the ancient drake that she wished to be his sacrifice. Panicked, you had to make a quick decision.|
277|Legend of the Dragon Knight|Sec 4: Awakening of the Drake's Soul|When you got to Golden Plains, Ganne looked concerned. Kimmy was there earlier; she left you a tablet. Ganne clearly felt uncomfortable giving you such an important item.

You instinctively knew that inlaying the blue crystal into the tablet would teleport you to Kimmy's current location. Ganne, horribly worried about Kimmy, urged you to act quickly.|You arrived at Torreyace's location and passed his tests. However, it was too late; Kimmy had become his sacrifice. You watched Kimmy grow weaker and weaker before your eyes. 

You brought the bad news and Kimmy's document to Ganne. Ganne, heartbroken, hoped you could bring the document to Amos and Zephyrinus.

Moments later, Amos annouced that Aven had entered high alert mode. You also learned from Zephyrinus that Kimmy was the princess of the Toroto Empire. Now it all made sense; she wanted you to save her people, and she was willing to die for the cause.|
278|Searing Valley|Sec. 1: Sudden Evil|From the familiar voice of Athena Marie, you learned of big changes coming to Searing Valley. You followed her instructions and hurried from Blackflame Peak to Searing Valley to meet retired Ranger Rora.

She explained that Searing Valley was once a peaceful, quiet valley. Though the creatures who dwelled there were tough and rugged, most never left their natural habitat, preferring to live in quiet harmony in Searing Valley. One day, though, everything changed, and many of the creatures suddenly became violent. The lives of those who dwelled there were in danger.|After hearing the situation, you decided to lend a helping hand to Rora and the researchers. You'd have to get rid of the Giant Crabs around the Cottage and acquire the blood of the Crawl Dragon to make a special serum.

You managed to help Sally recover an important piece of equipment from the ravaged campsite. This instrument would allow important medical research to continue. You also drove away the Invisible Monsters, saving countless lives in the process.|
279|Searing Valley|Sec. 2: Rescue and Reversal|Although the cottage was no longer in danger, Team Leader Blanche and Retired Ranger Obspho still hadn't returned from their search for the other team members. Matisse was quite concerned about this turn of events.

After confirming their original plan with Rora, you decided to begin looking for them.|You carefully followed the search parameters and analyzed the possible directions they could have taken. Finally, you located Blanche and Alcarter; they were both injured.

You confirmed that the rest of the cottage's personnel were safe. However, they informed you that they had set up traps to take out the Giant Beast that plagued the area. The monster managed to destroy the trap and had escaped into the depths of Crypthale Hillside.|
280|Searing Valley|Sec. 3: Uncharted Cave|Apparently, Blanche and Obspho planned to quietly observe the entrance of the cave where they had set the trap until the Giant Beast emerged. They had seen traces of the lost researchers, Claire and Eddy, nearby. They desperately wanted to solve the mystery - and take out the monster.

You felt you had no option but to go to Crypthale Hillside and save the duo before the vicious monster found them.|Inside Crypthale Hillside, you found Claire sobbing inconsolably. She explained that a seal within Crypthale was badly damaged. Her husband Eddy had gone to repair the seal, but she feared for his safety. She asked you to follow the hill trail and find him.

Unfortunately, you were too late; as you made your way through the thick brush, you uncovered Eddy's corpse, mauled by the monster. You decided to take on Ulysses, the violent Vilespire Demon worshipped by the ogres, to prevent any further tragedies. You defeated him, then made your way back to Blanche to explain what had happened.|
281|Searing Valley|Sec. 4: Mutiny|Devastated, Blanche handed you a secret letter and asked you to take it south of Gustgate Scout Towers to Deputy Leader Chay. Though Blanche would prefer to deliver the letter himself, his body was much too weak to carry out the task.

You were puzzled to see markings from the Toroto Empire on the envelope, but you decided to follow Blanche's instructions and deliver the letter.|Chay scanned Blanche's letter, an eyebrow raised. He still harbored some ill will toward you due to the incident with his mentor, but he knew he would have to set the past aside, as he needed your help.

He explained that many monsters had suddenly spawned within the bounds of the Toroto Empire. The Rebel Army had a good deal of research about these beasts, so he asked you to infiltrate their camp and gather any information you could find. Evidence was mounting that the enemies were somehow pulling the strings behind the scenes: did they somehow control these savage beasts?|
282|Searing Valley|Sec. 5: World War Mode|The Shadower Oldettia and Soul Walker Skol simultaneously felt a strong power awakening within the Guillotine. Oldettia requested that the Eternal Guardian enter the Guillotine to find the lost Prophet Burinaw, who was following Antor.

When the Eternal Guardian found Burinaw, she explained that the source of this strange power was the formerly kind-hearted Sacred Spirit King Gaddis. Long ago, the king used the power of light to help his followers. However, the power could not permeate his people's dark hearts. Eventually, it turned against them and began destroying what it deemed a hopeless, repugnant race. This genocide did not end until the other Sacred Spirits united to seal the power away.

Burinaw explained that this was an enemy the Eternal Guardian would soon have to face; the Guardian would have to prepare for the fight of a lifetime.|On the Eternal Guardian's way to stop Antor's sinister ritual, the hero killed the guardian of the ceremony, Abyss Angel Statue Moa. After a bloody battle, the spirit's energy was absorbed, and it evolved into Hollow King's Dark Mage Antor.

The Eternal Guardian, held up by these battles, did not make it in time to stop Antor's ritual. The imprisoned Sacred Spirit King's seal was greatly damaged, and a part of the Sacred Spirit King's manifestation managed to slither through a crack in the seal. The Eternal Guardian learned from Burinaw that all the released Sacred Spirits had gathered together in one place. They planned to reseal the evil Sacred Spirit King, but in the meantime, the Eternal Guardian would have to defeat the Sacred Spirit King's physical manifestation.

After a difficult battle, the Eternal Guardian finally overcame the Sacred Spirit King. Burinaw vowed to help the Sacred Spirits reseal the Sacred Spirit King. She asked that the Eternal Guardian take the Sacred Spirit King's manifestation back and look for Oldettia. Oldettia thanked the Eternal Guardian profusely and revealed that the Shadowers would stay in Death Valley to help the Dust Tribe's Drakai rebuild their homeland.|
283|Searing Valley|Grimoire - Searing Valley's Ecosystem Notes|Ecologist Danu's notes mainly concerned his many travels, though there were also several references to ecological studies. 

He came to Searing Valley's famous Volcanic Springs to observe the rare creatures there as well as its ravaged natural wonders.|"The first night he arrived in Searing Valley, Danu and a local hunter sought out crabs. Locals ate the sweet crab meat and used the tough shells to build houses."

"Grandma explained to him that strange organisms inhabit the forest; legend has it these plantlike creatures protect the forest and are armed with razor-sharp petals and strong tentacles that could choke the life out of even the strongest man."

"Danu finally arrived at Mire Ring. There, he witnessed the Anteaters slathering themselves with sticky mud to protect against the Volcano Ants' attack. He also saw what looked to be humans covered entirely in mud."

284|Searing Valley|Grimoire - Battle of the Dragon - Final Chapter|This Grimoire shall record the story of the Eldest Prince, a man who became the king and led an army against the self-declared Second Prince, his jealous brother. I, General Barton, declare that every word within the pages of this book is true. 

After years of being pursued, we arrived at Searing Valley's Hallow Canyon. We saw the enemies' camp, but we somehow got involved in a rumble with some vicious Mermen before we could get to our final destination. |After a struggle, we finally shook the Mermen and arrived at the Hot Springs area. That night, we set up camp and rested, but our campfire drew Crown Lizards and Pangolins to us, and they attacked mercilessly. Thinking back to Grandma's advice, I used fire to fend them off. 

Finally, we invaded the Second Prince's main camp at the observational deck site. Although the odds were stacked against us, we had come much too far to back away. The battle was long and difficult; our enemy was stubborn.

All battles must come to an end, though.  The King and the Second Prince met to discuss their issues, and ultimately, with a heavy heart, the King killed his brother, the Second Prince. I'll never forget this tragic battle. |
285|Sunrise Plains|Sec. 1: Revolt!|As you soared in an airship through Sunrise Plains, you looked down upon a wide, open field and the heavy gates to a fort. After you landed, you asked a soldier about the situation at the fort, but he was loathe to tell you much.

As you prepared to leave, frustrated by the soldier's lack of response, the soldier called you back. He needed your help. Apparently, the Fruticosa Beast reappeared to wreak havoc on the land, and the army was no match for it. They needed you to slay the monster.|After you solved the soldier's problems, he handed you a letter and told you to wait at the gate for a certain young woman. You went to the gate and were immediately dubbed "Andre." Though you were thoroughly confused, you went along with it.

You followed a woman named Lady Kailey into the castle; she explained that the Toroto Empire was facing revolt from within and invasion from without. The Son of Destruction still had to be eliminated, and the rebel revolution was threatening any semblance of peace. Kailey asked for your help, and something in her desperate plea persuaded you to oblige.

Lady Kailey asked you to head to a farm full of volatile villagers. There, you located Assassin Kasam and destroyed him. Kailey was pleased with your success but remained fearful; apparently, evidence existed that prominent officials supported the revolt. In the face of such treachery, Kailey needed your help more than ever.|
286|Sunrise Plains|Sec. 2: Mercenary Group|Someone nearby was watching you, so Lady Kailey had to keep up the act and sneak you a creased piece of paper.

After she turned to leave, you unfolded the slip of paper. Her voice echoed in your ears as you read the note; she wanted you to take on the task of destroying the dangerous Vinescale Dragons and Toxiscale Dragons.|After destroying the dragons, you peeked at the note from Lady Kailey and discovered that the Rebel Army was behind the destruction. You followed the note's instructions and headed to Tectonia's campsite. There, you found Akafon, but he didn't exactly fit Kailey's description.

After speaking to him, you realized he was a master of deceit and had disguised himself to trick rebel surveillance. Unfooled, you destroyed the First Quarry area's Rebel Army and mercenaries. Afterward, you headed into the depths of the minefield to destroy Bartleby.

Upon arriving at Tectonia's Second Army campsite with the letter in hand, you found Lady Kailey's confidante, Military Dept Agent Kuddy. You gave him the evidence on Bartleby, and he told you he would report to Kailey.|
287|Sunrise Plains|Sec. 3: The Truth of the Revolt|After receiving the information, Kuddy seemed uneasy. He explained that a supply cart from Toroto Empre was attacked by Grizzly Beasts; many of his soldiers were injured, and all the rations were stolen.

The army did not have the manpower to send out another supply cart, and unfortunately, the troops would suffer due to lack of nutrition and supplies. Kuddy asked you to slaughter the Grizzly Beasts and retrieve the supplies - and, while you were at it, he suggested you bring back some tasty bear meat. |After you solved the problem with the rations, Kuddy learned from a letter attached to a carrier pigeon that the Blue Crystal the empire wanted to ship to the frontline had been stolen by the Rebel Army. The information was deemed reliable, as it was from Princess Kimmy and was obtained at great cost. The Blue Crystal, he explained, was the only way to defeat the Bane Prince.

To protect Kimmy's Spirit, you teamed up with Kuddy and headed to the Dragon's Nest Hill, where the Mercenary Group hid. You did your best to vanquish the enemy.

After decoding the letter from Lady Kailey, Kuddy explained that Kailey knew which officials were involved in the revolt. You had to take care of the Mercenary Group Leader, Benton. At the Second Camp, you'd have to take out another traitor: Rose Temple's Duke Dascha Adwim.|
288|Sunrise Plains|Sec. 4: Rose Temple|Because of your valiant efforts, Kuddy and his cohorts were able to take back the stolen Blue Crystal from the Mercenary Group and simultaneously take out a good chunk of the enemy forces.

As he was finishing the report to bring back to the Toroto Empire and present to Lady Kailey, Kuddy got word from a Scout Trooper that the  Mercenary Group was regrouping and planned to attack again. Furious, he decided to go after the cads again. He gave you the letter and asked you to deliver it to Kailey.|After reading Kuddy's report, Lady Kailey asked you to gauge the severity of the incident. She asked the main gate's guard to open the fort's entrance and told King Karoein of the news.

Lady Kailey presented evidence about the mutinous officials to the king, discussing the murderous Mercenary Group and the stolen Blue Crystal. King Karoein was furious at this breach of trust and honor. He managed to quell his rage long enough to thank you for your hard work. 

At the request of Lady Kailey, you attempted to suppress the revolting major officials at the Rose Temple. After an arduous battle, you finally defeated all of the subordinates and reported back to Kuddy.|
289|Sunrise Plains|Grimoire - Euptellea|This book tells the story of a teenaged girl named Euptellea. The selfless young woman took care of her ailing mother and gathered herbs in the forest to make money to support her family.

One day, she entered the forest as usual and happened upon a precious herb known as Fatoua; this rare herb fetches a high price. Euptellea ran toward it, unaware that Fatoua usually attracts fearsome Fruticosa beasts.

Suddenly, she found herself surrounded by Fruticosa. Her breath caught in her throat as she thought of her bedridden mother; if Euptellea died, there would be no one to take care of her beloved family.|Luckily, Toroto Princes Tiento and Fade came to her rescue, and the three became fast friends. The princes often accompanied Euptellea on her excursions to the forest.

Prince Tiento felt that the young lady was putting herself in danger each time she ventured into the forest to find herbs, so he brought her a chest of golden coins. He hoped she would never have to gather herbs for money again. However, that same day, Prince Fede showed up at Euptellea's door. The two brothers began to argue over their friend's affections.

Their feud indirectly wound up causing a tremendous fire at Euptellea's house, and she fell gravely ill from smoke inhalation. There was nothing the princes could do. They realized they had behaved foolishly. Unfortunately, learning this lesson was not worth Euptellea's life.|
290|Sunrise Plains|Grimoire - Luminary|This book details the appearance of Luminary Lovix in Toroto. Lovix was a selfless, brave hero admired for his stoicism and skill.

Lovix stepped up to help when a dragon attacked a group of merchants. He saved a great deal of men that day, and though the grateful leader of the merchants offered to make him the Caravan Guard, he turned down the offer and continued on his way.|Princess Natalie of the Toroto Empire loved adventure and mischief, and one day, she found herself surrounded by vicious Grizzly Beasts. Lovix saved her from certain death, but it wasn't exactly love at first sight. The two bickered all the way back to the castle.

Rumors began to circulate that mercenaries were conspiring against Lovix because of his relationship with the princess, and a Red Wing Knight deputy leader planned to challenge him to battle over Natalie's honor. 

Annoyed by the constant stream of challengers and desperate for a new adventure, Lovix left town. Soon after, the princess disappeared. No one has seen either of them since.|
291|Devastation Realm|Sec. 1: Kasi's Predicament|You took Tectonia's crane to get here and were shocked by what you saw. A stench of rancid meat seemed to infiltrate every last inch of breathable air, and it filled you with dread.

You looked around the Vanguard Station and found Kasi nearby. Though he immediately went on the defensive when he saw you, after you explained why you had come, he let his guard down a bit. 

He explained that monsters surrounded their campsite, making life miserable for anyone who managed to survive. He begged you to help, and you decided to take care of his problems before moving on to anything else.|After you took out the Thorn Devil and the Vile Devils, Kasi explained that the Burnt Lumber Mill's Sinister Grizzlies and Manticores were dangerous opponents; they had prevented him from taking over the Southwestern territory. You headed back to Burnt Lumber Mill to finish off the monstrous gang.

Back at the campground, Kasi asked you to find out the fate of the Patrol Army, specifically Kumaly. He explained that you could get status updates from Florence. 

Kumaly wasn't faring well, and the military doctor asked you to obtain a Cannibalpede's bones and fluids. These items could be made into a medicine that might heal her. Kumaly begrudgingly swallowed the wretched potion the doctor cooked up, and she began to recover almost instantly.

You learned that a glowing red Cannibalpede dwelled in a nearby graveyard. It was believed that this beast could be giving off a scarlet glow due to a Red Crystal embedded in it. You headed to the cemetery to take out the Cannibalpede and retrieve the Red Crystal.|
292|Devastation Realm|Sec. 2: The Crumbling Village|After describing the relationship between the Red Crystal and the Bane Prince, Kasi gravely explained the truth. Before you arrived at the Devastation Realm, he had sent a squad south to Hazard to look for survivors. He hadn't heard back from anyone; apparently, the entire army had vanished.

Intelligence Staff Sami was leading the army; you knew that she was incredibly talented and skilled, and she wouldn't go down without a fight. You feared something terrible had happened to the army and decided to head to Hazard to look for clues.|You found a weary Sami in Hazard. After destroying zombie-like soldiers and the Villager's Ghosts, she explained that the Town Mayor possessed a Treasure Box guarded by a giant beast.

After successfully destroying the Dark Troll, you found the mayor's journal inside the Treasure Box. Apparently, the Town Mayor brought the curse upon the town because he coveted the power of the Vilespire Temple. His lust for power led him to mutate himself and the other villagers. In the final pages of the journal, you learned that the mayor fled to the Vilespire Temple looking for answers.

Accepting Sami's request, you personally went to Vilespire Temple to find the mayor. After destroying the Tentacles Gang at the entrance, you located the mutated Town Mayor and knocked him unconscious, then returned to Hazard to report back to Sami.|
293|Devastation Realm|Sec. 3: Vilespire Temple|After Sami finished the journal, the truth was at last revealed. The Town Mayor was not merely lusting for power. In fact, he was desperate and mired in depression, as his beloved granddaughter Reese had recently died. He believed that the Vilespire Temple's Ancient Gods could bring Reese back to life.

Sami asked you to return to Vilespire Temple to get to the bottom of things. Did the Spirits and Ancient Gods truly exist?|You found Reese's ghost in Vilespire Temple. She explained that evil spirits dwelled within the temple, plotting to lure humans into the temple and kill them. These savage creatures also imprisoned ghosts within the temple to sacrifice to the Vilespire Demon. 

Reese told you that the Vilespire Demon was actually Toroto the Third. At his side at all times was his trusted ally, Red Robed Archbishop Kinmo. Reese asked you to destroy Toroto the Third; doing so would free all the imprisoned, tortured ghosts and souls.

After you wiped out the Vilespire Demon and his minions, Reese asked you to do her one final favor. She closed your palm around a locket featuring photos of herself and her grandfather, the Town Mayor. You brought the necklace and the journal back to Sami, who said she would carry out Reese's last request.|
294|Devastation Realm|Sec. 4: The Eve of Battle|Sami remembered something important she had to tell you. Apparently, when they were escaping, they heard a tremendous explosion and saw a light barrier wash over the land in the northwest side of Hazard.

Sami asked that you head toward the light, as she sensed you might find some clues about Devastation Realm.|Upon arriving at the Magic Barrier, you met Ramond, a former instructor, who claimed the Bane Prince planned to use the Red Crystal's magic to force open the Dimensional Fissure. Ramond, greatly weakened, used the last of his magic powers to create a Light Barrier in the hopes of attracting the attention of an Eternal Guardian who could help.

You helped him destroy the Champsosaurus and Forbidden Blaze Demon, and in doing so enabled him to banish the evil aura invading his body. Drained of magic, Ramond asked you to head to the Crystal Staircase and retrieve the Red Crystal, which could revive his powers.

Finally, Ramond explained that a Gatekeeper guarded the dimension's entrance. He gave you a Blue Crystal that could force the Gatekeeper to appear. After you took out the Gatekeeper, Ramond told you that the Bane Prince's final battle was drawing near. He warned you that you might need reinforcements and urged you to recruit more Eternal Guardians. |
295|Devastation Realm|Sec. 5: World War Mode|Feymbur told the Eternal Guardian that the Bane Prince's whereabouts had finally been discovered. The Bane Prince stole the Devil's Dictionary and had chosen Century, a fort permeated by an evil aura, as the perfect place to summon the Ultimate Demon.

Reacting to the news, the Eternal Guardian quickly traced the Bane Prince to a nearby area. Rose Knight Endena, who was an expert at tracing spiritual waves, frantically searched for a way to stop the Summon Ritual.|The Eternal Guardian managed to slay the gatekeeper demon the Bane Prince summoned, Newgage. Meanwhile, Endena attempted to stop the Bane Prince from invading the Rose Temple. Roberto bravely sacrificed himself so that his comrades could escape.

The Bane Prince tormented Roberto's spirit, bringing him back from the dead as his slave. Endena, devastated by this development, was close to an utter breakdown.

After a bitter struggle, the Eternal Guardian put an end to Roberto's suffering and killed the mastermind, Bane Prince Fanning. The hero also successfully defeated Abyss Archdemon Farfa, thus foiling the Bane Prince's sinister plot once and for all.|
296|Devastation Realm|Grimoire - Diary of a Madman|This book details Madman Toben's strange history. Doctor Monteaux wrote it and recorded the events from Toben's perspective, allowing the reader to get a glimpse into Toben's twisted, mad mind.

After his wife passed away, Toben began seeing images and illusions. His hallucinations seemed incredibly real. Unable to withstand the torture his psyche inflicted upon him, he sought Doctor Monteaux's help. Unfortunately, it was already too late.|One day, Toben saw the image of a phantom tormenting his wife's ghost. Furious, he picked up an axe and hacked away at the phantom. Only when he finally calmed down did he realize he had actually slaughtered one of his friends. Panicked, he ran away.

His thoughts began to distort, and he believed he had to return to town to save the villagers. Once he arrived, he saw Manticores filling the streets, gnashing their terrible teeth. He raised his axe to slaughter the beasts, only to later discover he had killed innocent men.

Sobbing, he stumbled to his wife's grave. He found himself suddenly struck with extreme hunger, and he spotted a smorgasbord of delicacies in front of him. He began to shove the food into his face, realizing too late that he was eating a Cannibalpede. The larvae inside him swallowed his soul, and he became a Cannibalpede himself. At last, he could be with his wife, whose corpse was also devoured by the vicious insects.|
297|Devastation Realm|Grimoire - The Destroyer's Journal|This journal tells an incredibly violent and bloody tale.

The Royal Scholar was loathe to read this journal, but he was eager to decode its contents, so he asked the Toroto Scholars to look into it. Sken Brian received the empire's approval and published the journal for all to see.|The journal's writer broke away from his "family" because he did not feel they believed strongly enough in his violent philosophies. He raised some fearsome Tentacle Monsters near Vilespire Temple and unleashed them upon innocent people.

He then used his own flesh and blood to feed an army of Champsosauruses.

Aftering being summoned to the Crystal Staircase, he gained power from the blood of the Muncher and the Red Crystal. He absorbed its massive powers - or at least, he attempted to do so. His journal trails off at this point, so no one knows whether or not he succeeded.|
298|Eloise Plains|Sec. 1: Dust Up|War loomed in the horizon. Athena Marie anxiously informed you of Braider Kingdom's sudden seccession from the Federation of Valencia and their declaration of war on the Toroto Empire. This blood bath will yield no survivors on either side, so it became your duty to journey to Eloise Plains, headquarters of the Braider Army, to learn what triggered the war. Perhaps you could find a way to end the violence.

You arrived at Gowen Mountain Troop's tunnel straight into the heat of a fierce argument between three powerful individuals regarding the war. Shadow Ranger Lucchese had the audacity to stop the troop and demand that Princess Paisha and Prince Columbia of the Braider Kingdom withdraw their forces and retreat. Tensions ran high, opinions flew like knives in the argument. It would be impossible for the three of them to come to an agreement.

A sudden explosive sound interrupted the fight, pulling their minds from the problem for the time being. The prince and princess were forced to withdraw, but this would be only a temporary decision as they headed out to investigate the source of the mysterious sound.

Teaming up with the Braider Prince, you discovered a gaping meteor crater blocking your path; it had upturned everything in sight. There, you encountered Lucchese once more. He feared that this travesty would happen, but not so soon. He was quick to add that at least the tragedy had stopped the army from pushing forward.

As you investigated the situation together, Lucchese's respect for you steadily solidified; your unique analytical skill and perseverance impressed him enough for him to confide in you his secret: Lucchese was the Braider King's bastard son! His pleas filled your ears; you had to help convince the prince and princess to see Lucchese's way in order to stop the war before too many lives were lost.|Talking sense into the prince and the princess was like pulling teeth from a rabid wolf; they insisted that not even a falling meteor was enough to to prevent them from carrying out their plan. They mocked Lucchese, claiming that he was a coward trying to get out of fighting in a war. Such comments were the straw that broke the alpaca's back; in a fury, he lashed out, immobilizing them with his mysterious power. Fortunately, he returned to his senses before harming anyone, ashamed of his outburst.

Braider King Molman, who had watched the whole event during his quiet, unexpected arrival, barged into the scene, kicking Lucchese out of the camp for his inability to demonstrate restraint. The king also berated the prince and princess for sending troops out behind his back.

Though you were surprised to see King Molman here, he had not reflected that surprise. He reinforced his determination for attacking the Toroto Empire, but the reasons why remained a mystery. Perhaps the best way to gather clues about the situation would be to ask the Braider Camp soldiers.|
299|Eloise Plains|Sec. 2: Palace Dangers|Guard Ballou believed that the Braider King was behind the war. Information from Army Sympathizer Lawling and Leather Merchant Kant also led you closer to the truth.

A few days ago, someone had kidnapped the Braider Queen, leaving behind an incriminating letter from the Toroto Empire. It would make sense that the Braider King would declare war on the Toroto Empire for this reason, but the details of the situation did not fit. The Empire was already knee-deep at war with the Bane Prince; why would they draw additional trouble to an already bleak situation? You decided it best to visit the Braider King again, determined to clear the air of these troubling questions. 

As you entered the Braider Camp to establish an audience with the king, a woman in Toroto army garb popped into the scene, immobilizing everyone in the camp. Recognition blanketed Molman's features; he agreed to follow her only if she promised not to hurt anyone else.|The mysterious woman's power resonated with you; you could sense her enormous strength. What kind of power did she wield and where did it come from? Not even Toroto's most powerful mage came close to eclipsing her magical strength. Perhaps she wasn't from Toroto at all... This information fell on the prince and princess's deaf ears; nothing would stop the war.

The intuitive Princess Paisha noticed how similar the woman's power was to Lucchese's. Suspecting him, the prince and princess dispatched soldiers to capture him for questioning.

With Ballou's assistance, you located Lucchese first, informing him about King Molman's situation. With surprise, Lucchese admitted that what happened did have something to do with him, but it was supposed to have been a harmless, preventative action. Somehow, it had taken an ugly, unexpected turn. Concerned, Lucchese pleaded for your help again.|
300|Eloise Plains|Sec. 3: Etherworld Meteor|The key to this dilemma waited within the depths of the crater. You and Lucchese entered it separately, you battling your way deeper inside until finally encountering a hideous creature at the bottom. Before you could deliver the first blow, a mysterous man suddenly appeared to slay it before you.

You are challenged to a duel by this stranger, with the promise that he would tell you all about the meteor if you could defeat him. The battle waged, you seized the upper hand, victory drawn near... in the last snatches of battle, the man released a power similar to the woman's at the Braider Camp, turning the odds of this duel to his favor. Your life now hung in the balance as you struggled fiercely, futilely, to win....

At the precipice of defeat, the mysterious man paused as Lucchese appeared behind him.|Lucchese introduced the mysterious man to you -- his partner, Watcher Duran. The reason Duran tried to attack you was to help you understand how to fight against the "Etherworld Power." That would have been nice information to have! In either case, it would be best to battle such a strange power with a strong will.

After a fight like that, you remained suspicious, but knew you had bigger priorities to fulfill - you must still find the king. So, the three of you set out to do just that, and Duran managed to find a lead. The king was being held in a cave at Netherfell Forest! To find this potentially elusive place, Duran gave you a device that could detect Etherworld Power. However, enemies with such a strong, mysterious power could not be a force to be trifled with.
|
301|Eloise Plains|Sec. 4: At A Standstill|Duran's rather nifty device eventually led you to the depths of Gowen Mountain. How did Lucchese get there before you and why didn't he take you with him? In any case, you assisted in battling monsters until a Watcher arrived with more bad news - the army was marching out! The prince and princess had given the order, despite the army being so ill-prepared.

Anxiety brimmed over Lucchese, but he tried to conceal it by grasping for a solution. You began to brainstorm with him, but Lucchese managed to make up his mind before you could even start. The two of you would venture to the Troop's Tunnel together to stop the army from advancing.

The army had already made tracks towards Troop's Tunnel by the time you and Lucchese had caught up to them. You managed to find the prince and princess at the front lines. Once again, Lucchese tried desperately to talk them out of the war.|As stubborn as ever, the prince and princess still wouldn't change their minds. Desperate with worry, and finally realizing that he would never get through to them with words alone, Lucchese used his sweeping power to immobilize the prince, princess, and their entire army. Royalty, however, could not be controlled so easily. Having tasted Lucchese's power before, the prince and princess managed to break free from his magic grip. They could see his actions only as traitorous and dangerous. Lucchese, weakened from subduing an entire army, had not the energy to defend himself.

The penalty for treason against the crown was death. There was no way you were going to allow something like that to happen to Lucchese, so, with terrible - or impeccable - timing, you stepped directly into the path of the prince and princess's powerful death blow. Luck, however, was on your side; Lucchese managed to gather enough power to teleport the both of you safely out of the Troop's Tunnel. Just in the nick of time!

Despite being labeled a traitor and having almost been killed, excitement filled Lucchese. The army had been stopped for the time being, making the mission a success. He asked for you to continue looking for the king while he recovered his strength.

With nothing else pressing, you returned to Gowan Mountain to meet with Duran. Lucchese's current condition did not worry him. What did worry him, however, was the change in plan. Lucchese was supposed to be the one to rescue the king; now you would have to do it in his place.|
302|Eloise Plains|Sec. 5: Ghosts of Yore|To aid you in your quest to rescue the king, Duran suggested that he enter the cave with you to eliminate anything standing in your way while you pushed forward to the king.

As you entered the Dark Tide Cave, Toroto soldiers ambushed you, all of them wielding Etherworld Power. Duran and the other watchers distracted them with their own barrage of attacks, leaving you open to find the king. You pressed forward into the cave's dark depths, eventually encountering and defeating <Tremblebeast> Lochero. As the creature fell, you were surprised to see Braider Queen Illenia waiting for you. She urged you to hurry with her; the king's life was in imminent danger!

The queen was right; escorting her deeper into the cave eventually led you to the king. Relief flooded your senses enough to not see the blow coming - the "queen" immobilized you with Etherworld Power! You realized with dismay, as her magic disguise unraveled before you, that the person you thought was Queen Illenia was actually the king's former mistress, Dinah!

As with Dina's disguise, the truth became undone. She had impersonated herself as the queen after killing her under the vow to provide a better life for her people. As she had come to know the king, she realized that she wanted to continue to share her life with him once the Braider Kingdom had fallen. You were an obstacle to her carefully-arranged plans. Before she could take your life, Lucchese suddenly appeared to intervene, blocking Dinah's attack and freeing you from her power.|Wrought with fury, Dinah couldn't believe that her own son would betray her; again and again he had foiled her plans! Unleashing her rage, she engaged in a fierce battle against Lucchese, eventually overtaking him. You used this time to break from Dinah's bonds, picking up the fight, magic colliding in a terrible display of power and survival. Unable to withstand the attacks, Dinah, weakened, collapsed in pain and defeat. The power holding Lucchese and the king dissipated with her fall.

Dinah, her mind shaken by defeat, expressed regret for her actions as her body began to disintegrate. Her sorrow and apologies moved the king; he held her in his arms, grieving the loss of the woman he had spent so many years with. Lucchese could do nothing more than stand quietly to the side, his body trembling.

At long last, Lucchese finally laid out the truth of his actions. All events were done by the Barbarians in order to lure the Braider Army out of Hayward Seavale, disguising themselves as citizens from the Toroto Empire to make the trap more enticing. The meteor was a small island from the sky that fell against the earth, the energy to keep it afloat drained. To counter against these attacks and to protect the kingdom from the Barbarians, Lucchese founded the Watchers. This was when he informed you of a larger, looming threat - another floating island was about to collide against Hayward Seavale! Such an event would cause unprecedented devastation.

With his actions decided, the king engaged his troops against the Barbarians who were currently drawing in the floating island. He ordered Lucchese and his watchers to find a way onto it while you were asked to prevent it from crashing into Hayward Seavale.|
303|Eloise Plains|Book: Army Horrors |Every new recruit to the Braider Camp received a warning: Never go out alone at night, to patrol or otherwise.

No one took the warning seriously, until soldiers started getting hurt....|"There was once a new recruit who used his intellect, ambition, and strong work ethic to climb the ranks. It wasn't long before he started working directly under the general.

His last promotion, however, drew jealousy out of the other soldiers. They started targeting him for attacks and spreading rumors that he got his rank disgracefully.

The recruit shrugged it all off at first, but eventually it got to be too much. He had to fight back. This decision, however, proved to be a grave mistake..."|

What's wrong with that, you said? Well, if you're the only one that could see, hear, and touch this girl like he could, you may see a problem!

It all started when Vidic visited Hayward Seavale to conduct business...|"Oh, the travesty! Traveling Merchant Vidic was plagued by something troubling: a beautiful girl was obsessed with him!

It all started when Vidic visited Hayward Seavale to conduct business...

Early one morning, Vidic and his associates entered Hayward Seavale with the intent of selling their wares. Before they began, Vidic took a look around the market they would be selling at, and a very special necklace caught his eye...."
|
305|Hayward Seavale |Sec. 1: Meteor's Fire|With things at Eloise Plains taken care of, the king returned his army to Hayward Seavale. After some time, you followed, only to find yourself in the middle of battle. Citizens everywhere were being rescued by the Braider Army from monsters. 

A distressed King Molman explained that the city had been ransacked by rampaging monsters, the gates sealed by an unknown power. The prince, princess, and Lucchese had snuck into the city through the sewage system in order to help clear an escape route. The king asked you to assist them.

You met with Castle Guard Captain Nova at the entrance to the sewers, who hoped you could eliminate some of the flying monsters causing them problems by attacking at their landing spots.

Defeating these flying monsters was a breeze, though Captain Nova's worries have shifted to what could be going on inside the city. Unable to leave his post, he asked you to enter as soon as you could, seeking out Guard Commander Polos.
|As you passed through the city sewage system into the city, you witnessed monsters attacking castle guards. Despite their struggles, they held their positions to provide a safe escape path for the citizens trapped inside.

Quickly, you found Commander Polos who informed you that citizens were still trapped in their homes, terrified by the monsters outside. He asked you to clear away some of these wandering monsters so that the people trapped inside could escape safely.

After assisting the citizens, Polos shared with you fresh intel: the monsters seemed to be coming from the Plebeian Row! He hoped you could seek out the Barbarian Summoner behind the attacks.

You found injured castle guards and the Barbarian Leader in the area. His timing convenient as always, Lucchese suddenly arrived to help. The castle guards, however, didn't recognize that they were being rescued. Instead, they blamed Lucchese for Hayward Seavale's tragedy, thinking him a member of the Barbarians. Lucchese, not wanting his emotions to cloud his anger, left the area instead of confronting their accusations, leaving the guards to you.

You returned to Commander Polos, informing him of the completed mission with suggestions that he should send someone to bring out the injured guards. Satisfied by your report, Polos complied.|
306|Hayward Seavale |Sec. 2: City In Peril|Ah, the sweet exchange. After your report, Commander Polos gave you a report of his own: he found the current whereabouts of Princess Paisha, requesting that you help her devise a solution to the monster problem. The princess, once found, greeted you with appreciation and apologized for her earlier attitude. You could sense, however, that she still hadn't forgiven Lucchese.

Princess Paisha had been brewing a potential attack against the Barbarians trying to summon the island. A special task force was a heartbeat away from engaging in a mission to prevent this potential catastrophe. She asked you to join the mission. 

With your help, the ritual summoning the floating island had been snuffed, but it did not ease Paisha's worries. The final words of a Barbarian, "It's too late!" lurked in her mind; what could it mean?

The current situation would have to take precedence over this worry, however; the Cracked Meteorite Monsters roaming about weren't exactly welcomed in the area. Paisha asked you to eliminate them.
|Dying guards strewed the ground in the wake of your fight against the Cracked Meteorite Monsters, their anguished cries like sour notes in the air; there was nothing you could do for them. One guard had enough strength left to tell you of a particularly large Cracked Meteorite Monster, controlled by Barbarians, heading to higher ground. The Barbarians must be up to something...

The battle against Gozalaka commanded considerable skill and strength, but you stepped from the situation victorious. You returend to Paisha, reporting your events, and she informed you of Prince Columbia's whereabouts in the Nobility Realm. That was when Lucchese appeared.

Stubborn to the last, Paisha did not believe that Lucchese could be trusted, despite the king's assurances. Frustrated by this, Lucchese vanished, but not before telling you that all summoning rituals until now were hoaxes; the real ritual would be performed at Hayward Seavale's highest point.

The dying guard's words flash through your mind; this news was very important! However, Paisha pleaded with you to check up on Prince Columbia in the Nobility Realm first.|
307|Hayward Seavale |Sec. 3: Destruction Begins|A guard stopped you just as you were about to leave, anxiously alerting you to the Barbarians surrounding the house. Paisha instantly assumed it to be Lucchese's doing. In her rage, she demanded to the Barbarians a fight, but quickly realized that the Barbarians were not sent here by Lucchese; they were hunting him down instead.

You cleared the house of the swarming Barbarians, but the princess had her own inner demons to battle. Her mother killed by Lucchese's mother... Lucchese being her half brother... Lucchese, being part Barbarian, was an enemy to the Barbarians... What a situation! With your help, Paisha calmed down, coming to terms with these strange facts.

At the Nobility Realm, Prince Columbia had expected to see Paisha, surprised that you arrived alone. After giving your report, the prince explained that they had found the location of the summoning ritual - Braider Congress - currently sealed by the Barbarians' strange power. Only three people could withstand such power - you, the princess, and himself. Relying on Paisha to catch up, you headed out with Columbia for Braider Congress.|Clearing a path to Braider Congress was a death-trap for many soldiers, but their deaths were not in vain as you managed to make it there. Princess Paisha rendezvoused with you and Prince Columbia, the three of you then moving forward to the Congress main hall. Lucchese and his watchers were already there, all of them laying on the ground, dying. You rushed to Lucchese, relieved that he was still alive. The power that seeped from his wounds was familiar - that of the red crystal.

Then Bane Prince Dascha Adwim slipped from the shadows, his ominous laughter echoing in the halls like a death toll.

His dark, destructive power rendered your group helpless as he announced his plans to use the falling island to destroy the whole of Hayward Seavale. Then he vanished with the dying Lucchese, leaving behind a fierce monster to finish you off.

All hope seemed to be lost, save for the warm, familiar energy reverberating inside you. Seizing this buried power, the blue crystal's energy burst from within you, banishing the dark energy trapping you. Revitalized, you defeated the monster, also freeing the prince and princess.

You arrived back to the Nobility Realm, King Molman waiting with a deep-seated worry about Lucchese. He knew, however, that many more lives hung in the balance; he placed all of his hopes on you to save the Braider Kingdom.

308|Hayward Seavale |War History: Signs of the Counterattack |The letter Captain Lesko received while on a mission abroad was enough to abort his current task to return to Hayward Seavale immediately.

His troops knew that Hayward Seavale was under attack, all of them prepared to fight. What they didn't know was that they would be returning to a living hell.|With the aid of mutated humans, the wizard controlling the others was defeated, but only a few victims were saved. We decided to push forward to the Nobility Realm to rescue more endangered citizens.

Our troops parted ways with the mutant humans, grateful for their help, but some of us couldn't help but wonder if they would eventually become monsters and turn on the unchanged citizens. Trust is a difficult thing to keep in times of war, so Captain Lesko ordered me to form a specialized group to protect the people back at the shelter while the rest of the troop continued to the Nobility Realm.

We obeyed without question, confident in our ability to fulfill our task, but as the Hayward Seavale I knew and loved crumbled and changed around me in the grip of chaos and destruction, I could not help but worry about the captain's safety.|
309|Hayward Seavale |Diary: Floating Island |Reporter Misa's distinct handwriting filled the pages of this diary; it described the events that occurred in Hayward Seavale after the monsters invaded. Trapped with other citizens, she recorded his experiences with them - their fears, their hopes, their struggles to survive. One by one, the number of survivors began to dwindle, Misa beginning to wonder if she should have left the area back when he had the chance.

The last diary entry seemed to not have been written by Misa at all...|Captain Lesko's plan to rescue the area's citizens was carried out a few moments too late; reporter Mace was brutally attacked by the monsters and severely injured.

At Misa's request, Captain Lesko designated a squad to take the surviving citizens to safety while the rest pushed forward to the Nobility Realm. Flying monsters, however, swarmed the Realm's skies, descending upon the troops with deadly force.

Only some of the troops managed to escape. Captain Lesko was not one of them, perishing as he fought for his homeland. The last diary entry, however, written by Captain Lesko, contradicted this fact. Perhaps Lesko hadn't died after all...|
310|Durango Kingdom|Sec. 1: Mystic Floating Island|Destruction surrounded Duran as he gazed out at the ruined city, a winged horse at his side. You reported the events at Braider Congress and how Lucchese was captured. Relief overtook Duran; Lucchese wasn't dead.

The key to preventing the floating island's fall was the column of light that maintained its momentum. The winged horse would carry both you and Duran to the island where Watchers were already waiting.

The efficient Watchers had already established a temporary stronghold by the time you arrived. According to Lucchese's intelligence reports, Etherworld power permeated the island, driving the natives on it mad. It was all the Watchers could do with their power to protect their camp from the dark energy's influence. You were handed a special device to help you find the source of this power.

You eventually do, only to discover that it was Etherworld power keeping the island afloat. Duran would need to know this information with haste.|Duran, though grateful that you returned the equipment, was not able to recharge it. You needed to search the Barbarian camp for one that could not only communicate with humans but who could also recharge the device.

Your search produced a very unusual Barbarian, standing completely motionless and dressed in noble garb. A note inside a bottle read, "Follow the formula to create a potion, then feed it to the motionless person nearby." Intrigued by the message, you decided that it couldn't hurt to give it a try, so you concocted a potion to specifications and fed it to the motionless Barbarian. It was like pouring life into his body; he came alive, though his stiff neck movements and the way he cringed to the light suggested that he had been motionless for quite some time.

As you explained your situation, the Barbarian grew increasingly anxious. Able to only move his head for the time being, he suggested that you use the map in his pocket to find an important item he hid before he had befallen his stationary situation.

A large, gaping hole was the only thing that awaited you at the map's location. When you reported this news to the Barbarian, fear and despair consumed his features.|
311|Durango Kingdom|Sec. 2: Shuttered Magic Palace|The Barbarian revealed himself to be Ancient Kingdom Elder Matrox; he wanted you to find equipment that could control the gate of Kahlo Tower, the palace of this island, the Durango Kingdom.

According to Matrox, a foreigner had visited this area 20 years ago claiming to be able to bring the ancient Kingdom closer to the earth. Intrigued by this very rare visitor, eager to explore new lands and new peoples, and not wanting to feel so isolated, the Barbarians agreed to this foreigner's instructions.

As time passed, their excitement started to wane into suspicion. What was taking so long? By the time investigators had discovered the foreigner's real plans, it was too late - Barbarians everywhere began to go mad. In a panic, the queen ordered every remaining sound-minded Barbarian to evacuate to the palace until things could be sorted out. Matrox was charged with obtaining the equipment that would seal the palace forever from intruders. However, it had taken him longer than expected to find the equipment; the queen's cowardice drove her to seal the palace temporarily, locking him out. Fearing that Matrox would go mad before her temporary seal would let him back in, he swallowed petrification potion, hoping for someone to arrive to help him. |Armed with this new information, you told Matrox that the palace was still sealed, but by destructive power, not the queen. Ever-hopeful, Matrox asked you to take a trinket of his to the palace; with it, you would be able to sense what was happening inside.

Talk about a handy trinket! with it, you saw how Dascha Adwim invaded the palace, the queen struggling to fight him off with strange incantations. Fueled by this distressing news, Matrox managed to think up a possible way to unseal the palace. Using a pendant as a means of communication, he would be able to walk you through the steps.

What genius! Matrox's plan worked; through his guidance, you managed to unseal the palace. Duran managed to find you as you entered, informing you that the other Watchers were now on the island; he wanted to lend a hand in your mission. You informed him of all that you've learned regarding Matrox, the queen, and Dascha Adwim.
|
312|Durango Kingdom|Sec. 3: Invading Kahlo Tower|You wanted to press into the palace, to save the queen as quickly as possible. Duran, a voice of reason, delayed you, pointing out the runes etched on the wall near the palace entrance. According to the ancient writing, seeing the queen required you to prove your worth at three different locations, or else doom would befall you.

The trials were a grind; after wave after wave of fighting Barbarians and monsters, you finally managed to prove your worth to see the queen. Duran, however, was not so lucky; he had failed the trials and turned into a mutant barbarian. You would have to go on without him. 

Your timing, however, was a bit too late; Dascha Adwim had just managed to extract the information he needed from the queen. Your arrival, however, at least seemed to surprise him.|Dascha Adwim thought HE was surprised - you discovered, to your utmost dismay, Lucchese under his control! With villanous intent, Lucchese began to attack you; it was all you could do to block his advances and avoid hurting him. Brief periods of self-control seemed to bleed through Lucchese; he begged you to kill him before he was forced to do something he regretted. You refused; you would not see a dear comrade dead! The power of the blue crystal awakened to this surge of emotion, ever-stronger by the strange, otherwordly energy surrounding you. You released this power, shattering Dascha Adwim's control on Lucchese and the Durango Kingdom soldiers.

Not expecting such a devastating setback, Dascha Adwim escaped through a portal, leaving behind a verbal threat to annihilate everyone as soon as he obtained the power of Iyernafalo.

The queen had a lot of catching up to do. You informed her as quickly as you could about the circumstances behind your arrival to the floating island. She, in turn, told you that Dascha Adwim would be going to Durango's sacred area, but she was quick to assure you that he would encounter great resistance there. This would provide her with the time needed to take you and the other surviving Durango Kingdom citizens to that same place in order to attempt a cure.
|
313|Durango Kingdom|Sec. 4: Holy Land Firmament|Teleportation was always disorienting; this time was no exception! You arrived at the Durango Queen's holy land, which had become a refuge to the surviving island's citizens. Hopelessness blanketed the area like an invisible mist.

At the queen's request, you retrieved the Flawless Gem from the Hallowed Prayer Altar. Being able to use the item to cure her people was a great testament of her power, but could she recharge the floating equipment? The queen seemed hesitant to help, but finally she handed you an orb with the power to lift the Etherworld magic from the Durango Kingdom citizens. If it could do that, it must also be able to recharge the equipment. However, a great risk was involved; it could turn the already frantic Durango Kingdom citizens into complete monsters. Unfortunately, with lack of better options, it was this way or no way. You now understood the queen's initial reluctance.

Perhaps it was luck, a blessing, or fate's good graces, but the the orb managed to completely cure the Durango Kingdom citizens. Though strong-willed, the queen could not overcome her great relief. Hope pierced through the kingdom's heavy despair like rays of light through the clouds; a future had returned to the Durango Kingdom.|Finally, the floating equipment was recharged! This meant, of course, that bad news was sure to follow. This bad news came in the form of Lucchese having woken up from a coma and leaving despite being barely strong enough to move. Stubborn to the last, just like his siblings! The queen could only guess that he had gone to Iyernafalo. The best way to get there without a winged horse would be through the Lumin Stairway. You wasted no time in setting out.

You eventually found Lucchese's winged horse near the Lumin Stairway, but without Lucchese. The nearby spots of blood worried you; what was Lucchese practically killing himself for? Using the winged horse, you searched for him, eventually finding him resting, weakened, on the side of the road. Despite his injuries, the bodies of monsters were strewn around him; he obviously still had some fight left in him. |
314|Durango Kingdom|Sec. 5: Fearless Sacrifice|Struggling just to find the strength to speak, Lucchese informed you of Dascha Adwim's true motives: he planned to use the power from the floating island's core to tear a hole through time in order to step into the past. Firmly, you gave Lucchese your word that you would never allow that to happen. Relieved by your promise and trusting your words, Lucchese collapsed into a much needed sleep.

In pursuing Dascha Adwim, you came across a Holy Land Goddess statue. A heavy, thick evil seeped from behind the statue; Dascha Adwim was just on the other side. How, however, could you move beyond it?

Adruptly, the statue split down the middle as though lightning had struck it, the barrier banished with the crumbling of stone. The dark energy pressed against you, overwhelming in its intensity; you could barely stand.

Dascha Adwim's dark, ominous laugh followed. The Bane Prince had destroyed the sculpture. The Bane Prince had access to the core. Dascha Adwim was about to win in this long, hard battle that had spanned three countries and taken countless lives. Subduing your rising anger, you braced yourself, weapons at the ready, and stepped through the barrier to put an end to this dark sorcerer's schemes once and for all.|Dascha Adwim had prepared for your arrival. Almost immediately, you were attacked by other bane princes. They were no match for your power, but you, unfortunately, were no match for Dascha Adwim's Power of Destruction, enhanced by the core. Relishing in his victory, the Bane Prince gushed over the all of the suffering he would inflict upon you for the many times you sabotaged his plans.

His power was too much; you began to believe Dascha Adwim's words. Perhaps this really was the end for you. Lucchese, however, had not come all that way just to rest on the side of a road! Using his last bit of strength, he charged the Bane Prince, prepared to sacrifice himself to save you and the Durango Kingdom. All of Dascha Adwim's scheming had not prepared him for this one final setback in his plans. Enraged, unable to accept his end, he screamed as he and Lucchese tumbled into the dark portal meant to end your life.

All that was left of Lucchese was his weapon. Grief gripped you; how, as the Eternal Guardian, could you not save Lucchese, someone who did so much for you and received so little in return? The frustration almost overwhelmed you, but holding Lucchese's weapon brought you to your senses. This loss was the price you had to pay as the Eternal Guardian; it could not stop you from your ultimate objective.

Dascha Adwim's death had disoriented the swarming Etherworld monsters; the Haward Seavale warriors were able to quickly subdue them. What was once a chaotic situation was now coming under control. You delivered Lucchese's weapon to King Molman and the Durango Queen, informing them of what happened in Iyernafalo. The war against the Bane Prince may have ended, but a battle still raged in your heart. The toll for victory, Lucchese's sacrifice, was almost too much to take. You vowed to yourself that you would become stronger so that something like this would never happen again. |
315|Durango Kingdom|Unofficial History: Durango Kingdom |Mage Lena could not resist her own pursuit for knowledge - she embarked on a journey to learn about how magic could be used to protect people. As she travelled, she met other mages who shared her ideals, so they travelled together.

Such a scholarly pursuit became a more difficult task than Lena had anticipated; all she seemed to find were more questions. As such, she broadened her scope, desiring to discover the meaning and origins of magic as a whole. Little did she know that she had sparked a legend.|Officially separated from the Central Continent, Durango Kingdom's new borders now consisted of several emtpy islands. 

When Lena, the Durango Kingdom's leader, stepped down, she transferred power to the Elder Council. Away from the eye of politics, her daughter became a writer instead of a diplomat, with children of her own. Several years later, however, the Council eventually gave the kingdom back to Lena's heirs.|
316|Durango Kingdom|Diary: Sealed Away Memories |Once upon a time, in the quiet of the Netherfell Forest, a man and a woman fell in love. The woman was from the Central continent while the man was from the Etherworld. Though they had two very different backgrounds and came from two very different, distant worlds, their personalities meshed well together as they slowly got to know each other.

This was the beginning of their story, recorded in this diary.|Eventually, distance and the sad circumstances of life forced the two lovers apart; they never saw each other again. The woman opened a studio at Hayward Seavale where she painted every place she and her lover had ever visited.

The man, in the meantime, disappeared from existance. No one knew where he went, everyone assuming him dead. The woman, however, always believed that he was still alive, hoping for the day that they would meet again.|
317|Ethereal Dome|Sec 1: A Little Preparation|You learned from Athena Marie that the Orphid Tribe on the southeast mainland was making preparations for an important prayer ritual; however, a strange, evil presence had been emanating recently from the Ethereal Dome, and Marie was worried something would go horribly wrong.

Heeding her instructions, you made the long journey through Viper's Forest to reach the enigmatic Ethereal Dome and the Orphid Tribe, intent on stopping this evil force from invading the land of Aven.|Once there, you helped Orlam collect Lavender Leaves, and he introduced you to the other members of the Orphid Tribe. You were granted a meeting with the tribe's chief, Feda, and you explained to him your reasons for coming.

Chief Feda seemed blissfully flippant and told you everything was in ship-shape and couldn't be running more smoothly. He did agree, at least, to keep an eye out for anything suspicious. You decided to stay and lend the tribe your aid in preparing for the ritual, while also picking up bits and pieces of information on the side.

You couldn't help but find your curiosity piqued by Priest Brio's brusque, chilly attitude, as well as the fact that he continuously found it necessary to assign you menial, pointless tasks.|
318|Ethereal Dome|Sec 2: Truth and Illusion|You found yourself impressed by Anna, a thoughtful, caring girl from the Orchid Tribe. After you collected a feather from the Spotted Toucan for her, she wove the prayer knots that would be used for the upcoming ritual.

She asked you to take the knots to Chief Feda, and you agreed with a bob of your head before taking off for the chief.|Chief Feda instructed you to travel to Orphidia and wash the knots to prepare for the ritual. Upon arriving, you happened upon Orlam, but were surprised to find him gravely injured. He explained that it was all the fault of Priest Brio!

It seemed that Brio wanted to interrupt the ritual. You raced to the Sacramental Altar to stop him from casting his wicked spell, but it didn't take long for you to discover everything was a lie.

It wasn't Brio who wanted to interrupt the ritual - it was Orlam himself! An evil force had taken control of Orlam and tricked you into attacking Brio in the middle of the ritual. With the ritual incomplete, Orlam was able to enter the will of the Tree of Life itself - the Camodor Chastelands.|
319|Ethereal Dome|Sec 3: Camodor Chastelands|With Brio's help, you followed Orlam into the chastelands. Once inside, you found Chief Feda, wounded.

Feda had observed the fight between you and Orlam and attempted to stop him on his way into the chastelands; however, he was no match for Orlam and the evil power he now possessed.

He asked you to make your way to the very depths of the Camador Chastelands and stop Orlam before he could commit the unthinkable. You headed off at once to throw a wrench in Orlam's plans.|As you made your way through the chastelands, you ran once more into Brio. He was suffering from a grave wound and informed you that only his spell could put a stop to Orlam once and for all.

You defeated the monsters hounding the poor man and took him with you to the chasteland depths. The two of you found Orlam deep within the chastelands and commanded him to cease his atrocities. In the proceeding battle, Brio called upon his magic to take down the crazed son of a chieftain and put a stop to his plans.

Upon Orlam's defeat, the very embodiment of the Tree of Life appeared before you and revealed who it was that had bewitched Orlam and stolen the life essence from deep inside the mighty tree.|
320|Ethereal Dome|Sec 4: Through the Fog|Though you couldn't stop the evil force from taking the Tree of Life's essence, Chief Feda attempted to reassure you all the same - after all, had you not come to the aid of the Orphid Tribe, they might have all been killed.

Much still needed to be done within the dome, so the chief asked you to make your way to Jahrra Camp and respond to their request for assistance.|Once there, Janice explained how an unknown intruder had snuck into the camp, but, strangely enough, hadn't stolen a single thing. You investigated the area and discovered suspicious red soil near the camp. After a bit of detective work, you learned that this kind of soil could only be found in an orchard known as the Pomarral. You couldn't help but think that this all had something to do with the mysterious entity who'd bewitched Orlam.

Janice asked you to find ingredients for an antidote, and once it was finished, you sprayed it around the entire forest. During your task, you discovered a suspicious tablet on the ground. The grove's assistant, Larry, bemused that the tablet must have come from the Iceflame Highlands.|
321|Ethereal Dome|Legendary Pioneer's Diary|The Pioneer's Diary was a classic long passed down by the people in the Ethereal Dome. It spoke of a legendary soldier, Chiffan, who was the first man to settle in the Ethereal Dome.

Chiffan struggled to survive in the arid, unforgiving desert that once proliferated the dome.|He worked daily to support not only himself, but his pregnant wife as well. In fact, he pushed himself so hard that one day, his body simply gave out, and he collapsed to the ground.

The pick he had been using punctured the desiccated soil, and from it rose an endless supply of cool, clean water. This spring transformed the once harsh dunes of the Ethereal Dome into a fertile, verdant oasis.|
322|Ethereal Dome|Army March Diary|The Army March Diary was a record of one of the soldiers of Toroto. The print was sloppy, and the wording was ineloquent and uncouth.

Its entries described in great detail the arrogance and ferocity of Toroto's soldiers, as well as their setback on the southeastern mainland.|During their expedition, the Toroto Army pitched camp in the southern woods to rest for the night. At some point during the night, word came in that one of their soldiers had gone missing. A search party was sent out, but not only did they fail in finding their comrade, they, too, got separated from one another, lost in the endless sprawl of the forest.

It was daylight before the soldiers came crawling back to camp, visibly shaken. The leaders of the force held furtive meetings that lasted for hours, and finally decided it was in their best interest to draw back. After all, even the most powerful of armies turned to mere putty in the hands of nature's wrath.|
323|Iceflame Highlands|Sec 1: Eruption Eve|Larry conjectured that the slate you found was from the Iceflame Highlands, so you decided to head in that direction and determine exactly what it was doing in the Pomarral. After all, things like this didn't just happen by chance.|You reached the town of Blazeburg and discovered it was under attack by monsters! Using your quick wit and fierce skills in combat, you fended off the monsters and won the trust of the town's mayor, Mick. Mick explained that the nearby volcano, long thought to have been extinct, suddenly erupted, and the monsters around town had become violent without warning.

Cinthia, one of the town residents, relayed that she'd seen a Mysterious Stranger wearing a cape near the volcano's altar recently. You decided to head to the altar yourself to check things out and confirm if this man was indeed the one you'd been tracking.

You faced off against the Mysterious Stranger at the altar and successfully pushed him back. Your reward? A strange tablet he dropped upon exiting the scene. Curious, you took it back with you and discovered it to be the second half of the tablet you'd found previously. You showed the completed tablet to Mayor Mick, who revealed to you that the tablet was a present they'd given to the Hamlet of Gaeld as a peace treaty.|
324|Iceflame Highlands|Sec 2: A Pox in Gaeld|Mick didn't believe the suspect could have come from the Hamlet of Gaeld, but he also knew that he couldn't stop you from investigating. He wrote a letter explaining the situation and asked you to give it to the mayor of Gaeld.

Upon saying farewell to the villagers of Blazeburg, you headed off toward the Hamlet of Gaeld, tablet in tow.|Once in Gaeld, Sovchek assisted you in coming face to face with Mayor Fendis. You gave her Mick's letter, but she didn't seem entirely nonplussed. Apparently, a strange illness had begun spreading through the village, and people were falling ill left and right. You could imagine it would be hard to find concern about a stranger's plight when your own citizens were suffering.

You assisted the town's residents in finding clean water and food, but in doing so, you discovered strange traces of magic imbued within the water. You took the sample to Healer Camus, who admitted that, unfortunately, he could not test the water properly himself.

Naturally, you were beset with worry, so Camus put his brain to the test and finally remembered something from his years of magical research. He asked you to go to the snow field outside the village and bring back the flame from a Blueflame Horse. Perhaps, he explained, he could use such a flame to analyze the water. When you managed to bring back the flame in question, however, he informed you that Rheutear Temple had been invaded and Mayor Fendis desperately needed your help.|
325|Iceflame Highlands|Sec 3: Rheutear Temple|During your traipse through the snow fields, the guard in Rheutear Temple had been attacked, and the assailant had infiltrated the temple.

Fendis feared that the intruder could offend the River God that watched over them, but none of the villagers in town were skilled in combat. She then asked if you might be willing to enter the temple yourself and pursue the culprit.|Vegry described the intruder as very mysterious and swathed in a long cloak. It's just as you'd thought! No doubt, the assailant was none other than the Mysterious Stranger you'd been chasing. You quickly entered Rheutear Temple to track him down.

The path to the innermost depths of the temple was long, arduous, and full of ferocious beasts. When you finally made it to the grand hall, you were horrified to find Wanda, the Aqua Beast Summoner, unconscious in the middle of the room. You helped bring her back to the world of the living, and she rewarded you with the story of what had happened.

Afterwards, she used the last of her magic power to create an antidote for the affected people in town and handed it to you. The moment it reached your hand, however, the Mysterious Man burst forth from the shadows where he'd been hiding and destroyed the vial. There was no hope for the comatose villagers now! Wanda bemoaned the fate that had befallen them, but told you there still might be a way for you to rid the town's water of toxins. She then gave you the recipe for the antidote.|
326|Iceflame Highlands|Sec 4: Footprints in the Snow|You handed the antidote recipe to Mayor Fendis, who exclaimed with dismay that the ingredients could only be found on the fierce, aggressive beasts that lurked outside the village.

You therefore decided to collect the ingredients yourself! Before you left, Sovchek and the mayor asked you to be careful... and come back alive.|Once you gathered all of the necessary ingredients, you took them back to Healer Camus to get them made into a proper antidote, then poured the completed antidote into the lake to rid the villagers of their affliction for good. You returned to town and were told that Mayor Fendis had an urgent message for you.

Fendis had received a report of suspicious, muddy footprints in the snow around the entrance of the Hiemal Trough. You rushed off to take a look for yourself and noticed immediately that the mud was the exact color of the mud you'd seen back in Jahrra Camp.|
327|Iceflame Highlands|Village Ritual Tome|As many isolated regions of the world are difficult to reach and very seldom receive news from the outside world, they oftentimes have some very backward beliefs and cruel customs.

It is said that, long ago, in the southeast, there was a village that worshipped fire, and would hold a sacrificial burning ceremony every year. No one from outside the village ever witnessed this ritual, but according to records it was a brutal affair.|One year, a very different girl was chosen for the ceremony, and when the day of the ceremony arrived, she neither screamed nor struggled. Instead she simply waited for the flames to consume her.

From out of nowhere, a tremendous downpour extinguished the fire atop the altar, leaving the girl standing on the pyre completely unharmed. Her body began to glow with a blinding light, and when the spectators could once again open their eyes, the altar was empty save for a pile of ash where the wood had burned.|
328|Iceflame Highlands|Highland Legends|In ancient times, people had only a limited understanding of how the world worked and would offer strange explanations for the natural phenomena they witnessed. But perhaps not all of it is nonsense. A legend that's been passed from person to person for generations might contain even a grain of truth.

The bizarre landscapes of the Iceflame Highlands were not shaped by nature. It's said that in prehistoric times, the highlands were a place of scorching heat. Although they did not have all the niceties of a large city, they were completely self-sufficient. They continued to worship fire unabated, until one day, a man arrived...|The silver-haired old man listened to the villagers' pleas and transformed the highlands' climate and ecology. At first, the villagers were very happy, but it didn't take long for them to start reminiscing about the past, and soon they began worshipping the Fire God once again.

The old man, who had until then been revered as a god, became enraged. He went from village to village in search of the Fire Wielder, hoping to chase him out.

The struggle between these two opposing forces made the Iceflame Highlands into what they are today.|
329|Meeryasha|Sec 1: Blood-Red Energy|You strongly suspected that the Mysterious Stranger fled through the Hiemal Trough, and you learned from Fendis of something resembling a space-time rift deep in the valley.

Armed with this knowledge, you went to investigate the rift.|After encountering a strange girl by name of Margeria in the depths of the valley, you learned that the Rift in Space-Time led to a place called Meeryasha. You believed that had to be where the Mysterious Stranger escaped to and decided to accompany her there.

You switched roles with Margeria in order to help her out, and were able to help her resolve many problems. Eventually, though, you started to have more and more questions about her true identity.|
330|Meeryasha|Sec 2: Quantum Physics Institute|Using the ducts of the Quantum Physics Institute, Margeria was able to infiltrate the structure and record its floorplan. She described an enormous book repository - and hidden within the repository, a top-secret reference room.

She also described an interference device she made to prevent the institute's mechanical guards from transmitting information to the control center. With this device, you would be able to move around safely once inside.|After scouring dozens of documents in the secret reference room, Margeria finally uncovered the truth the government had tried to bury. She sat in stunned silence, unable to take it all in. Eventually, you were able to comfort her.

In the furthest corner of the laboratory, you discovered Lab Director Tycho. When you approached him in order to question him, he looked at Margeria as if he knew her.

However, before you were able to get any information from the Lab Director, a magical shockwave killed him where he stood. You immediately recognized it as originating from the mind-controlled Orlam.|
331|Meeryasha|Sec 3: Under the Hood|You and Margeria were overcome with shock at Lab Director Tycho's death. After long consideration, Margeria suggested going to the Alchemy Guild in Graylin in order to get more information from Secretary Yvonne.|After speaking with Yvonne, you both agreed to collect samples from creatures with aging mutations. She explained that time was supposed to stand still in Meeryasha, but for some reason, it had recently begun moving once more.

Unable to believe the person who broke into the secret room was her own fiance, Margeria felt lost, believing she would never see Dermot again. After revisiting the Alchemy Guild, you went to Sandu Crevasse and unearthed a Red Crystal with an energy similar to that of the Bane Prince.

With this new information, you reexamined the wild animals' mutations and confirmed that they had all been brought on by the government.|
332|Meeryasha|Sec 4: All Geared Up|Worried about Margeria, Yvonne advised her to go home and get some rest, asking you to escort her. Margeria tried to protest, but Yvonne insisted, and eventually convinced her.|When you reached Margeria's home, you learned she had a younger brother, but before you could inquire further, she discovered a letter from Dermot, insisting she meet him. She traveled to the location he indicated, where Dermot abducted her.

Accompanied by Yvonne and Derk, you went to Graylin and demanded to see Dermot, but the Gate Guard refused to let you in. Powerless to do anything, you returned to the Alchemy Guild. At the entrance to the guild, you encountered a panic-stricken Margeria.

She told you that she uncovered terrible government conspiracies in the secret room.|
333|Meeryasha|Sec 5: Singing the Blues|You and Margeria both believed that the person who abducted her was someone only disguised as Dermot. She asked you to help her get into Graylin so she could make Dermot come clean about everything the government was doing.|You encountered the Mysterious Stranger in the basement, and he revealed another piece of the story. It turned out that he used the power of the Tree of Life, along with Wanda's magic, to open the Rift in Space-Time, and that you were just a pawn in his master plan.

After the Mysterious Stranger revealed his plan, you learned the truth about everything else as well. At first, Dermot used Aubrey in his cruel experiments, and this was what turned Aubrey into the Bane Prince. Afraid Aubrey would come back for revenge, Dermot left Meeryasha and used a Red Crystal Device to stop the flow of time there, cutting it off from all contact with the outside world.

You obeyed Aubrey's wishes, burying his suspended body next to Margeria, so that he would never again have to leave his sister's side...|
334|Meeryasha|True Grit|According to ancient records, Graylin was surrounded by a highly-unusual magnetic field. Some evil force seemed to affect peoples' minds, turning them greedy and selfish in a never-ending quest for more money and power.

Tynost, however, possessed a special gene that made him immune to the magnetic field. He was the only one left who was still able to think rationally and logically.

Tynost could not simply stand by as everyone around him succumbed, so he decided to develop an alchemical technique to neutralize them.|Tynost was the only person not affected by the magnetic field, and as such, he decided to develop an alchemical technique to neutralize it.

But Iliana, a mage from a neighboring country, did not think Tynost could accomplish this alone, and used her own powers to help Graylin emerge from the crisis.

Sure enough, with Iliana's help, Tynost succeeded in finding a way to neutralize the effects of the magnetic field.|
335|Meeryasha|Ecological Treatise|Back when Meeryasha was still known as Alcheim, the whole area was a beautiful, pristine countryside as far as the eye could see, and was home to hundreds of different species of animals.

After its original discovery, which was purely by accident, greater and greater numbers of people began moving there. Eventually, their settlements grew into what is now Graylin.|With the explosion in population, the once-beautiful countryside became increasingly developed, and the burgeoning alchemy movement began contaminating the local ecosystem. Before long, the land had transformed into a frightening place inhabited by menacing creatures.

No one had suspected that the contamination would cause the local wildlife to mutate. Dearby didn't want things to get any worse, so he promised to think of a way to keep the best of both worlds: preserving the natural environment, but also keeping Alcheim as it was.

Under Dearby's leadership, everyone pitched in to undo the ecological damage. Before long, the trees began growing once again, and the landscape began to return to its former beauty. The residents began to pay attention to the natural world around them, and made efforts to preserve the balance of nature, even as Meeryasha grew larger.|
336|Mayland Jungle|Section 1: Infection Deflection|Director Haman in Fegeral Valley has delivered the unsettling news that strange creatures emerging from the Tunnel of Ruins have begun to attack villagers.

At the same time, there's been a plague outbreak in the Central Continent. You will need to investigate both of these issues.|Although it's too soon to be sure, some signs seem to indicate that the two issues may be related. In order to eliminate the plague threat as soon as possible, the Toroto Empire and the Valencia Union have decided to send a combined task force to investigate what caused the flare up.|
337|Mayland Jungle|Section 2: A Force, Of Course!|You arrive in the Central Continent along with the joint task force. To get as much information as possible, you visit the chief commanders of both sides of the operation and offer your assistance with the investigation.

However, your expedition runs into an obstacle in the form of a massive wall blocking your progress. Fortunately, Archmage Labhart also has some information about the region.|While the Archmage is looking into possible methods of bypassing the wall, some soldiers from the Toroto brigade are attacked by infected creatures, and become infected themselves.

The infected soldiers are suffering greatly. Their fellow troops, sickened by the idea of killing their own men, beg you to put the unfortunate plague victims out of their misery. In their final moments, the infected soldiers, who had previously seemed to have lost all grip on humanity, suddenly become clear-headed enough to thank you for helping them escape their terrible suffering. Hearing their words fills you with an even deeper regret at what you must do.|
338|Mayland Jungle|Section 3: Sie Sind Das Essen|The Archmage has discovered a magic spell using Mythic Beast's core and blood that should allow you to pass through the massive wall that's been blocking your progress.

If you want to get to the bottom of this plague, you'll have to find Mythic Beast core and blood. You should be able to get some in Batelo Valley.|You get lots of blood from the Beast Scions in Batelo Valley, and you also manage to pry a core from the Batelo Mythic Beast Rebecca. Now you're ready to conduct your magic ritual!

As the magic rite concludes, you can feel the power of the Beast Scion's energy coursing through your body, but you know it has come at great cost. As you recall the haunting expression in the Beast's eyes, all you can feel is regret at having sacrificed such a majestic creature. |
339|Shaxia Basin|Section 4: Shaxia Sneakery|Prince Columbia gives you a teleportation device. Once you've reached the other side of the ramparts, you can use it to summon Reconnaissance Soldiers to assist you in your investigation.

The Reconnaissance Soldiers have set up a temporary stronghold in an old warehouse. Reconnaissance Captain Lucy asks you to pay her a visit in the stronghold.|When you arrive, you notice a Shaxia girl who has been kidnapped by the reconnaissance troops. When you investigate further, you find that the strange creatures emerging from the tunnel have been dressed similarly to Shaxia Tribesmen.|
340|Shaxia Basin|Section 5: In Too Deep|To continue your investigation, you attempt to sneak into Shaxia Basin. However, you quickly find yourself in a heavily guarded area and need to retreat.

Reconnaissance Captain Lucy designs a camouflage suit for you so that you can infiltrate the area more easily, and asks you to go on a foray along with the Shaxia girl.|At the end of the Shaxia Basin, you and your companion see some Shaxia villagers coming under attack by infected tribesmen. You rush to help defeat their assailants.

Once you've driven away the infected tribesmen, Shaxia Patriarch Jananda asks you why you've come. You are about to explain when suddenly, the tribesmen lose their Beast Scion energy. It becomes clear that your own Beast energy has consumed theirs. It has long been foretold that a messenger with powerful Beast Scion energy would one day arrive to rescue Shaxia in its time of need. Could you be the long-awaited savior of Shaxia? |
341|Shaxia Basin|Chapter 6: Midnight Rescue|Shaxia Patriarch Jananda invites you to enter the temple where he intends to commune with the Mythic Shaxia Beast Nihilam. Inside the temple, he begins to summon the mythical creature.

Nihilam appears. Upon hearing the Patriarch's words, the Mythic Beast asks the Shaxia Tribesmen to approach. They begin to advance towards him when suddenly, the same strange creature you had seen in the Tunnel of Ruins appears and tries to stop them. Nihilam and the creature begin to fight: as Nihilam subdues and finally kills the mysterious creature, you notice its appearance gradually changing.|As the creature lies dead, its appearance finally stops shifting, only to reveal it resembles one of the Patriarch's own sons. In shock and outrage, Patriarch Jananda furiously attacks Nihilam. You join him in the fight, landing blow after blow upon the beast until finally it seems on the point of death. However, the beast still has one last trick to play; it explodes suddenly, killing and wounding many Shaxia Tribesmen in the process.

As the smoke clears, a phantom of Nihilam appears. He explains he is the wandering soul of a body which was hidden long-ago in Allolans by the mythic beast. He goes on to say that a mysterious, unknown man who intruded into the beast's body many years ago was what led to this series of catastrophic events.

The ghost, grateful for the help you and the Shaxia tribe have given him, agrees to remove Nihilam's curse from you so that you can fully exert your Beast energy.

When you return to the Central Continent, the plague has been eradicated. However, those who have died of the plague can no longer be resurrected. Although your heroism has saved a great many people, you cannot help but think it has come at great cost. Your thoughts keep returning to the Totoro soldiers you killed and the Beast Scion whose life you took in the struggle.|
