Since everyone is out fighting for their country, I want to do my part. I can provide our soldiers with food, but I'm in urgent need of ingredients!

If you find me some more Bear Meat and Eagle Meat, I can cook up something for our soldiers. Please bring some to me.|
198|L84. Feeding the Wounded|Quest Giver: Army Chef Batali

Quest Details:

I've heard that the rarer the ingredients, the more effective the medicine is. I've got wounded up the wazoo! We need all the rare ingredients we can get!

I need more rare fish and bird meat. Please bring some to me.|

200|L84. Gunpowder Galore|Quest Giver: Medical Officer Jolin

I need more Sturdy Bones and Crimson Ore. Please bring some to me.|
201|L84. Ingredient Shortage|Quest Giver: Military Doctor Florence

All our chefs have been sent to the front lines, and now I'm in charge of cooking food for our troops. I've been studying advanced culinary techniques from the best chefs from the Valencia Union. Hopefully I can make some delicious food for our troops.

I need more Bear Meat and Eagle Meat. Please bring some to me.|
202|L84. Feeding the Wounded|Quest Giver: Military Doctor Florence

Quest Details:

I've been a military doctor for a long time now. I'll let you in on a bizarre secret. The rare fish hiding inside Rock Kylin are a pungent, yet effective panacea! Rare fish and bird meat can be made into delicious dishes, too, so it's a win-win.

I need more rare fish and bird meat. Please bring some to me.|
203|L84. Armorsmith|Quest Giver: Temporary Blacksmith Kicco

The armor and weapons used by our soldiers are in a pitiful state. Most are old, rusted, and broken. I'd love to forge better gear for them, but I'll need a lot of raw materials.

I need more Sharp Spurs and Golden Ore. Please bring some to me.|
204|L84. Gunpowder Galore|Quest Giver: Telecom Soldier Lutin

Quest Details:

Our signalmen are in desperate need of communication supplies. I need more materials for making signal powder. Could you lend me a hand?

I need more Sturdy Bones and Crimson Ore. Please bring some to me.|
205|"Silver Needle" Fame Item - Jadite Ore|Commissioning Guild: Silver Needle

During forging and casting, different rare materials give our equipment unique characteristics. That's what makes our armor so superior to the competition.

Because of the unstable situation on the mainland, there's more need for our armor than ever before. Our reserves of <Jadite Ore> are running low. Could you gather some for us?|
206|"Pyrowinds" Fame Item - Jadite Ore|Commissioning Guild: Pyrowinds

If equipment has any hope of withstanding enemy attacks, only the highest quality materials should be used. Unfortunately, there's a shortage of raw materials and we're in desperate need of resupply.

At the same time, demand for our equipment has skyrocketed, and our <Jadite Ore> supplies are almost depleted. We would be indebted to you if you could bring us some.|
207|"Crystal Camel CoC" Fame Item - Greybear Hide|Commissioning Guild: Crystal Camel CoC

For merchants on long journeys to distant lands, the supplies they carry with them not only affect their profit, but could also mean the difference between life and death. As a result, we supply everyone with first-rate equipment.

Although wild beasts are fierce, their hides are very versatile. If you could bring us some <Greybear Hide>, we'll reward you handsomely for your trouble.|
208|"Amber Eye" Fame Item - Greybear Hide|Commissioning Guild: Amber Eye

Gems are the world's most captivating things. Not only does each have its own distinctive luster, but the right cut and shine brings out special characteristics in each gem. But gems don't dazzle and sparkle in the beginning. It's the result of endless polishing.

Polishing takes a large amount of rare materials to bring out that perfect shine. Right now, we're running low on <Greybear Hide>. I hope you can bring us some.|
209|"Ancestral Spirit Followers" Fame Item - Golden Silk|Commissioning Guild: Ancestral Spirit Followers

We commune with ancestral spirits in an effort to discover long-lost arts and technologies. Naturally, we have many secret ways of communing with the spirit world which we would never divulge to anyone... but they require specific raw materials that are difficult to collect.

We don't have the time or resources to gather them, so we would be delighted if someone could provide us with <Golden Silk>. Naturally, there'll be a handsome reward.|
210|"Sage Stone" Fame Item - Golden Silk|Commissioning Guild: Sage Stone

Using alchemy to change an item's properties is no problem for us. Whether it's strengthening its weaknesses or further enhancing its strengths, all we need is the raw materials.

But getting raw materials gives us a real headache. Some things are very scarce, like <Golden Silk>, which we are always short of. Could you gather some for us?|
211|"Nature Seekers" Fame Item - Scarlet Fir|Commissioning Guild: Nature Seekers

We've spent a long time observing the structure and character of nature. We understand how everything, from animals to plants to monsters, lives in harmony with each other. We use our knowledge of nature's innate properties to craft some of the world's best items.

Unfortunately, we're running low on the wood required for our research. If you could collect some <Scarlet Fir>, we could continue our studies. We'll reward you, of course.|
212|"Arcanum Association" Fame Item - Rainbow Energy|Commissioning Guild: Arcanum Association

We believe that arcane rituals are the source of all magic power. With bigger rituals, we can obtain power beyond our wildest dreams!

Rituals require a great deal of energy, and we're running low on our stockpile of <Rainbow Energy>. If you could bring us some, we could continue our ritualistic research. We'll reward you, of course.|
213|"Arthur Hammer" Fame Item - Red Spar Ore|Commissioning Guild: Arthur Hammer

Even with the world's best technology and knowledge, we're nothing without a legacy. We'll be forgotten with the sands of time, as transient as a shooting star. That's why we attach great importance to adding new members to our guild.

Unfortunately, passing on our knowledge takes patience and a whole lot of raw materials. The new recruits have used up almost all our supplies of <Red Spar Ore>. If you could bring us some, we'd be forever grateful.|
