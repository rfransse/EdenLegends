229|Mummy, I Want Milk|The Ranch Carnival Event was organized by <Ranch Owner> Brock to acquaint the locals with the wonders of nature and serve as a hard-earned break from the hum-drum of daily life.

Everyone knows that most Alpacas hail from Camina Ranch. It's also rumored that Alpaca milk can help children grow. A certain notorious <Supermom> Angelina is bosom buddies with Brock, which explains why her kids have suckled from the Alpaca's teet since they were in nappies. Her youngest child, <Chicken Tender> Leeroy, is so fond of Camina Ranch, that he continues to play there even today.

 One day, the Plump Chickens on the ranch were purloined by evil men who pumped them full of toxic chemicals, transforming them into <Hormonal Abomination> Plump Chickens. These oversized chickens developed oversized attitudes and used their increased strength to stage their very own chicken run. Now, these ferocious fowls are wreaking havoc all over Aven.
