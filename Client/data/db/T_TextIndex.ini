4849|Lilyam: It doesn't matter, everything doesn't matter. People who used to be heroes like you, don't they have to be imprisoned by me after death? Come out! Heroes! Let them know that here, only death is everything! |
4850|Torrias: You finally found this place! My soul has been waiting here for thousands of years. |
4851|Torrias: No need to be nervous, although you have defeated me, but that is just my body being manipulated, not the real me. |
4852|Torrias: After the physical defeat, my spirit finally awakened from the endless nightmare, all thanks to you. |
4853|Torrias: There are both light and dark aspects in our hearts, but a well-established soul can always balance the two and prevent either side from being too strong. |
4854|Torrias: At this time, I am in front of you, but there is only a bright side. Without the regulation of darkness, my soul will eventually be unable to suppress excessive emotions and gradually disintegrate. |
4855|Torrias: Please help me. Through this portal, I defeated my divided soul. Please remember that my two souls must be disintegrated at the same time in order to merge the two into one. |
4856|Torias: My weak soul can no longer deal with the shackles that have imprisoned me for thousands of years. Please help me to break this shackle so that I can regain my freedom. |
4857|Torrias: You will need a brave with a dragon-slaying sword to deal with my controlled body. This brave must withstand the terrible damage from the high-level dragons. You must help him withstand my attack. As long as I break the shackles as soon as possible, I will be free from the dreams that have been entangled for thousands of years. |
4858|Torrias: But please remember that the shackles that imprison me are equally effective for those who hold the Dragon Slayer sword. If you get too close, you will end up with death. Please be careful. Then! Let's get started. |
4859|Torias: I... finally free... but I have to find a place... rest. |
4860|Torrias: The things you saved me will never be forgotten. Although the dragons are proud, we will never be ungrateful. |
4861|Torrias: So that's it. We will definitely meet again. I look forward to that day. Goodbye, adventurers. |

5417| Philo: These blazing avatars are really annoying! Use "Dragon Tooth Assault" to defeat them in one fell swoop. |
5418| Philo: Go harder! Although the surrounding temperature continues to rise, it also means that we are getting closer and closer to the Burning Crystal. |

5433|Torrias: Well...this remark is worthy of fun. Before I reach a conclusion, you must first prove whether you are qualified to pursue this force. |
5434|Torias: This place was once a place where the light was revealed, and mortals with firm beliefs vowed to dedicate their lives to protect this place. Their determination is no different from yours, but they still cannot prevent the destiny of the temple being destroyed. |
5435|Torrias: Perhaps this shrine that is slumped in the past is like the future of the place you care about? |
5436| Philo: I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening! |
5437|Torrias: Many things are beyond human reach. When you know that the situation is no longer what you want, you can choose to escape to save yourself, or sacrifice yourself in vain, do you have to become the latter? |
5438| Philo: If sacrificing one's own life can have a positive impact on the situation, or can gather other forces that fight against fate, then everything is not in vain! |
5439|Torrias: These fragments of consciousness also have the same thoughts in front of you, their will is firm, and they still stand upright for their faith after death... Isn't this also the same as the fate you are about to encounter? |
5440| Philo: I am moved by their noble ideas, and I am not afraid to give my life for vows like them. |
5441|Torrias: That's true, then can you come to this door in their obsession? In their eyes, you are an aggressor. |
5442| Philo: Heroes, please rest in peace! I am not your enemy. |
5443|Torrias: Not the enemy? The name of the land you love so much has long become a nightmare for many people to fear and fear. This is an iron fact. |
5444| Philo: That is the consequence of our choice to escape! Now we are no longer escaping, from now on everyone will try to clean up the stigma, even if we know how difficult the process will be. |
5445|Torrias: Hahaha, whether the facts are as you said...you will know immediately. If you are not afraid of what is about to happen, go deep into the temple. |

5451|Torrias: This action will lead to charcoal, go back, don't waste time here. (Select the wrong option, please try again)|
5452|Torias: Finally, I will ask you again. Even if asking for this force will cost your life, you will be happy? |

5671| Ironshoe Eisengler: No way! The external plundering of the Toledo Empire must not be stopped, otherwise we will not be able to obtain resources to fight against the Son of Destruction from elsewhere. Are you going to watch the soldiers take the spoon to the battlefield? |
5672|Troframu: The troops guarding the Dawn Plateau are dispatched to the front line, and the rebel issue is temporarily suspended. I have already mentioned this. Maybe your marshal can take time to ask a military doctor to check your ears...or your head? |
5673|Troframu: Your Majesty, as far as I know, what the rebels and mobs want is food and clothing. If we gather all our forces, we will defeat the Son of Destruction with one effort, and we will eliminate other troubles forever. I believe that the issue of civil strife can also be combined solved. |
5674|Mrs. Kelly coughed slightly. |
5675|Eisengler: You guys who haven't been on the battlefield can only make a mouthful! Do you think army dispatch is such a simple matter? Do you think the army does not need to eat? Your Majesty, you must not believe his nonsense. |
5676|Troframu: Humph. Do you just look down on people who have never been on the battlefield? Did you know that from the small officials in charge of the revenues and expenditures of the army to our great King, they have never been on the battlefield. |

5681|Casoine: Okay, who's next? Mrs. Kelly, the sound of your cough makes me very distressed. You must take care of your body before General Kusky returns triumphantly. |
5682|Kelly: Thank you, Your Majesty, for your concern, but my body is much better than the battle on the front line. Just now, General Kusky sent communicator Andre back to ask for support, because our army on the front line seems to be unable to support it. . |
5683|Casoin: Is it coming after all... It seems that the situation is no longer for me to hesitate, Eisengler, immediately dispatch your army to rendezvous with General Kusky to fight against the Son of Destruction. |
5684|Isengler: Your Majesty...this...|
5685|Casoin: You heard my order clearly, Marshal. I should have given this order long before Princess Philo left because she opposed me sending troops to plunder resources. I really regret not listening to Princess Philo's suggestion sooner. |
5686|Eisengler: Yes! I will go back and gather the army. (Eisengler is gone in a huff|
5687|Casoine: The others also step back. In the current national crisis, I believe you still have a lot to deal with. |

6381|You should hide in the blue circle of (129,146) as soon as possible. |
6382|There are several evil auras in the space, and I feel the Son of Destruction approaching here. Hurry up to the stone pillar lurking aside to spy on the conspiracy of the Son of Destruction. |
6383|Son of Destruction: "Son of Eternity! I know you are here! We can clearly feel each other's existence!"|
6384|Son of Destruction: "Son of Eternity, is the power losing? This forbidden black magic is quite useful, isn't it? I have heard your painful whisper."|
6385|Son of Destruction: "Before I die, I will play with you, and the other sons of eternity will fall one by one. I will cause everyone to suffer pain, hahaha!"|
6386|Son of Destruction: "Always keep saying that you want to protect everyone. It's hard to take care of yourself as you are now! Okay, get out of here!"|
6387|Son of Eternity: "Too careless... can't let everyone fall into crisis, this bit of pain is nothing! We must crush the ambition of the Son of Destruction!"|

6392|"Are you...?" You are very surprised by the person who suddenly appears in front of you|
6393|"Where is the guy from? The group!" The Destruction Son shouted angrily|

6400|"There are soldiers here who need your help."|
6401|"The enemy general seems to be very tired, and occasionally loses his guard, and when he loses his guard, he gives a fatal blow."|

6403|"There is an enemy attack? Run away!" The people in the camp fell into chaos in an instant|
6404|"The other side is in need of your help, hurry up and support it!"|
6405|"We are one step closer to victory, brethren, come on!" The general encourages and shouts to invigorate the military|
6406|"It seems to be the habitat of wild beasts when going forward. The enemy camp should be in the rear."|
6407|"It doesn't seem to be a good way to enter directly. If you can attack from a distance, it will be a lot easier. Discuss with the soldiers on the side to see if there is a good way.|
6408|"Enemy attack! Where did the enemy come from? Retreat first!" The soldiers in the camp are already in chaos|
6409|"The situation here is under control, please go and support other brothers!" said the leader of the team|

6413|I was found, retreat quickly! |
6414|"Oops! There are soldiers ahead, hurry up and stay away from them."|

6514|Raultras: Carumbair, please listen to me...|
6515|Prince Karumbair: Shut up! What you are facing is the leader of the army and the future leader of the country, find out who you are! Otherwise, I will judge you to disobey the order and deal with it in accordance with military law. |
6516|Raultras: ...Your Highness, we can't march rashly, please withdraw the order to send troops, the enemy we are going to deal with is not in the Toledo Empire! |
6517|Princess Pei Sharosa: Hmph, Raul Triss, I thought you could have any new words to conceal your timidity, but I didn't expect it to be the same. It really disappointed me. |
6518|Raultras: What I said is true! The enemy has been hiding behind us, we must immediately deploy our troops back to defend the city of Philip Hayward...|
6519|Prince Karumbair: Enough! Don't say "us" anymore, Raul Triss. Shut your cowardly mouth before the marching army. |
6520|Prince Carumbair ordered loudly: Army! go ahead! |
6521|Raultras: No...Your Highness! |
6522|Boom! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! (There is a huge impact sound from a distance)|
6523|Prince Carumbair ordered loudly: Army, stop! |
6524|Princess Pei Sharosa: What's the matter with this voice? |
6525|Raultras: Your Highness, please...|
6526|Prince Kalumbair: Withdraw troops! I don't need you to tell me too, Lauertres. Rosa, we have to figure out what the noise is. |
6527|Princess Pei Sharosa: Good. Scouts! Use the fastest speed to find out the truth, and then return to the main camp to report to us. |
6528|Soldier: Yes! |
6529|Prince Carumbaer gave a loud order: The army returns to camp to reorganize its posture! Maintain a state where troops can be sent at any time, and we will let the Toledo Empire pay the price later! |
6530|Military: Yes! His Royal Highness Prince! |
6531|Raultras whispered: Please wait, son of eternity, I have something to discuss with you. |
6532|Raultras: Your Royal Highness, about the meteorite that fell from the sky, I think there are some things you should know here, that meteorite is actually|
6533|Prince Carumbair interrupted: It was just a natural disaster accident. Fortunately, it did not cause any casualties. I have notified the relevant personnel to deal with it, and now I should focus on the dispatch of troops. |
6534|Princess Pei Sharosa: And you? Brother, have you regained the courage to go to the battlefield? |
6535|Raultras: Your Highness... That meteorite is not just a natural disaster. Here is the report provided by the scout I sent, which can prove -|
6536|Prince Carumbair: Stop, I don't want to discuss meteorites anymore. You can give the report to the geologist and wait for our triumphant return to pay attention to this issue. |
6537|Raultras: Then we should listen to the opinion of the Son of Eternity. As an outsider, he must be able to see this war more clearly than we can. |
6538|Prince Carumbair: If the Eternal Son is willing to assist us in sending troops to attack the Toledo Empire, we will indeed listen to his opinion. |
6539|Raultras: Isn't it possible anyway to let you stop the idea of sending troops and think about other things...|
6540|Princess Pei Sharosa: Don't you want to go to the battlefield anyway, brother? Or do you think this matter has nothing to do with you? |
6541|Raultras: I have never had this idea! |
6542|Prince Carumbair: Brad established the country with the spirit of chivalry, and if the knight is insulted, he must demand an upright fight against the opponent. Although I don't want to talk about it, your current behavior can only be described as a coward. |
6543|Raultras: I am definitely not a coward! |
6544|Prince Karumbair: That's not important, now, go out. |
6545|Princess Pei Sharosa: ... I'm disappointed, Raul Triss, I don't want a clown brother. |
6546|Raultras:...what do you know...? |
6547|Raultras: The knight is insulted and wants to fight to the death, right? Draw the sword! Raul Tris asks for a duel with Prince Karumbaer and Princess Pei Sharosa! You two go together! |
6548|Prince Carumbair shook his head and sighed: My patience is at its limit, Raultras.
Princess Pei Sharosa: Guards, all go out, things here are not allowed to discuss. |
6549|Princess Pei Sharosa: I am Pei Sharosa. I have finished reporting my name, so you don't need it, brother, I don't want to listen. |
6550|Princess Pei Sharosa: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! |
6551|Prince Karumbair: What did you do? Raul Tris? |
6552|Raultras: I thought you were not interested at all, how? Your Majesty, come and see you too? |
6553|Prince Karumbair: Humph! |
6554|Prince Karumbair: Uh...body...can't move...|
6555|Raultras: You all lost to me in a dignified duel. Now anyone wants to question my courage and determination? |
6556|Prince Carumbair: Courage...not...for dealing with...family...body...on...|
6557|Raultras was suddenly shocked:! ! ! I...I...I don't want to...(Laurtres untie the two of them|
6558|King Monette angrily said: What are you doing! |
6559|Prince Carumbair: Father.
Princess Pei Sharosa: ...Father
Raul Triss: Father... Father...|
6560|King Monette: Raultras, what reason makes you think you can challenge the leader of the commanding army? Do you think that being a prince can be spared from military justice? |
6561|Raultras: I...I was wrong, father, I'm sorry. |
6562|King Monette: Don't call my father, Lauertras, now you are exempted from your rank in the army and all rights as a nobleman. Now get me out of the barracks. This is not a place where civilians can come. |
6563|Raultras: Yes...Father...Your Majesty the King. |
6564|King Monnet: And what about you, Carumbaer? Pei Sharosa? I remember that the order I gave was to prepare for dispatch instead of dispatching troops immediately. Who will tell me what is going on? |
6565|Prince Carumbair: Father, the morale of the army is currently in a high state due to anger. I think sending troops now will be beneficial to the battle. Please give me a chance to prove my ability to lead the army. I will not disappoint you. . |
6566|Princess Pei Sharosa: This is a judgment made by me and the emperor, father. After recovering everything we lost from the Toledo Empire, we are willing to be punished for this decision. |
6567|King Monette: Calm down and think about it! You have already made the biggest mistake in using troops-rush forward! Don't make me feel that it was a wrong decision to hand over military power to you. |
6568|Prince Karumbair: ...yes...father.
Princess Pei Sharosa:............|
6569|King Monette: Son of Eternity, we just ended the discussion when the guards notified you of your arrival. During this period, have you realized the high fighting spirit of our army? |
6570|You nodded. |
6571|King Monette: So, will you assist us in sending troops to the Kingdom of Brade? |
6572|Just as you were about to answer, a figure suddenly walked out of the corner of the tent. |
6573|Women in Toledo uniforms: Monette...I finally saw you again...|
6574|Prince Karumbair: Be careful, father!
Princess Pei Sharosa: Who are you! How did you get in? |
6575|King Monette: Could it be...you...|
6576|Prince Karumbair: You are not allowed to step forward! Quit! |
6577|Women in Toledo military uniforms: Why is it so noisy...all of them shut up for me. |
6578|Prince Karumbair: Uh...
Princess Pei Sharosa: It feels... the same as Raul Tris back then...|
6579|King Monette: Let go of my children and I will go with you. |
6580|Princess Pei Sharosa: Dad...no...
Prince Karumbair: Father! Do not! |
6581|Women in Toledo uniforms: I have no interest in other people...Monette. I am here solely for you...|
6582|Women in Toledo uniforms: Then go, leave this place, this time you are finally willing to go with me...|
6583|Prince Carumbair roared: Stop ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! |
6584|Princess Pei Sharosa's eyes flushed: Is it too late...|
6585|Prince Carumbair gritted his teeth and said: You really provoke me... The Toledo Empire, I swear, before my father and mother return safely... This matter will never come to a good result...|
6586|Princess Pei Sharosa's tears glides over her cold face: they will definitely pay the most painful price. |
6587|The huge monster lurking suddenly sprang out, but at this moment you are horrified to find that you are suddenly unable to use your strength. |
6588|Mysterious man: Oh? It turns out that there is only missing out here. |
6589|Mysterious man: Ha, you even saved someone by the way, how did you come in... Hey, you are the son of eternity! |
6590|The mysterious man releases a burst of powerful energy to suppress you to the ground. Although it is accompanied by great pain, you find that your body is gradually able to move. |
6591|Mysterious man: Huh? Can move, it doesn't matter, it won't change much of the result. |
6592|Mysterious man continues to use unknown sourcesEnergy attacks you, but you find that the impact of that power on you is getting less and less, and your powerlessness is gradually restored. |
6593|When he found that he could no longer restrict your actions, the mysterious man suddenly stopped his attack. |
6594|Mysterious man: Hey, he is the son of eternity, he can resist this force so quickly, it should be enough for the time being to reach this level. |
6595|Suddenly footsteps came from behind. |
6596|Raultras: Huh? Have you guys met each other? |
6597|Raultras: Son of Eternity, let me introduce to you, these people and I belong to the "Watchmen" organization, and we have always taken action to prevent the next possible distress. |
6598|Mysterious Man: This is Frederic. I'm sorry for how offended I was before. This is just to give you a preliminary understanding of what you are likely to encounter next. |
6599|Fredri: Then I'll go first, Son of Eternity, we will meet at Aros Outpost. |
6600|Raultras: Keep a low profile...I don't want to be spotted by the soldiers sent by Pei Sharosa. |
6601|Fredry: Uh... I thought you ignored the part of keeping a low profile when you asked the Son of Eternity to help us. |
6602|Raultras: ...I sometimes really think you talk a lot|
6603|Fredri: Is it just "sometimes"? It seems that I have not worked hard enough. |
6604|You came to the depths of Gorn Mountain based on the luminous device, only to find that Raul Tris was fighting an unknown magical creature. |
6605|Raultras: Son of Eternity, are you okay? Now the entire cave in the mountain contains these magical creatures controlled by the power of the outside world. I think this is our enemy deliberately set up to delay time. |
6606|Raultras: Even if we know their purpose, we can only search every cave as much as possible...|
6607|Fredri hurriedly ran from the entrance of the cave. |
6608|Fredry: Lauertres, it's not good! Brad's army intends to forcibly form an army when the rations are not yet ready, and it is almost complete now! |
6609|Raultras: What! ? ...What are they thinking about! |
6610|Raultras: Frederic, please tell the members to continue searching for the whereabouts of the king. The Son of Eternity and I must rush to stop the sending of troops, please. |
6611|Fredri: Okay! I will definitely inform everyone. |
6612|Talking in the tunnel. |
6613|Raultras: Carumbair, Pei Sharosa, please listen to my last words, my father has not been taken out of Breeder territory, please stop sending troops immediately. |
6614|Prince Carumbair: Lauertres, I will only return to you for the last time. All the evidence shows that the Toledo Empire captured the king and queen of Brad. If you want to do something, please join Defeat Toledo's army, or it will disappear before our eyes. |
6615|There was silence in the narrow tunnel, the air seemed to freeze, and the king's children stood silently, making everyone uneasy about the upcoming conflict. |
6616|Raultras: I give up persuading you, Carum Baier. |
6617|Prince Carumbair seemed to breathe a sigh of relief: Very good, do what you should do. |
6618|Raul Tris drew out his weapon and said: The previous actions that offended you were made on impulsiveness and recklessness. I still regret and apologize for that matter. But this time I have thought about the consequences of doing this...|
6619|Raultras said loudly: In any case, the army must stop here! This is not a request, Karumbair, I will do my best to make it happen. |
6620|Princess Pei Sharosa drew out the weapon and said: I said it would be like this, Karum Baier. This is the consequence of you always giving him a chance. |
6621|Prince Carumbair showed a look of resentment: Raul Tris, even if you can defeat me, it is impossible for you to block the entire army by yourself. |
6622|Raultras said while accumulating strength: Let's see if it's impossible...|
6623|Raul Tris suddenly roared, and the power of another world rushed out of him and imprisoned all the soldiers in the tunnel. The soldiers' surprise and humming began to echo in the tunnel, and Raul Tris, who had released too much power, also knelt down weakly. |
6624|Prince Karumbair:...what...this power again...|
6625|Princess Pei Sharosa:...Oh...the soldiers are all...|
6626|Raultras said breathlessly: Withdraw...Kalombaer, your army...can't advance anymore...I'm sorry...but...I have to...do this...|
6627|Prince Carumbair gritted his teeth and said: You have crossed the bottom line, Raultras. Now that you know the consequences of doing so, then accept sanctions for treason here...|
6628|Prince Carumbair and Princess Pei Sharosa broke free from the control of the power of another world at the same time, and they looked at the weak Raul Triss with rage. |
6629|Raultras smiled weakly and bitterly: Sure enough...my strength...has been lost...you...the determination to send troops...|
6630|Raultras: Son of Eternity...it seems...I can only...go here, please continue...help...Fredre...they...|
6631|You look directly into Lauertres's eyes, which shows his unrepentant determination to die, but the intuition that comes to mind tells you that you can't let him die here. |
6632|Prince Carumbair frowned and said heavily: Raul Tris, until now I still treat you as your own brother, but your actions still have to be dealt with by military law, don't blame me. |
6633|Princess Pei Sharosa: ... Even if you do this kind of thing, we will still miss you. |
6634|Raultras closed his eyes and waited for what was about to happen, you stepped forward in a hurry to block between the three. |
6635|Prince Carumbair: That would be an offense, Son of Eternity. Raul Tres must die as a Brad knight. This is the last thing I can do for him as a brother. |
6636|Princess Pei Sharosa: Son of Eternity, be careful. |
6637|Under the cooperating offensive of Carombair and Pei Sharosa, you were beaten back and forth, but they didn't mean to hurt you. At this moment, Raultras was around The magical wave of transfer began to appear. |
6638|Prince Karumbair: What are you going to do! Raultres, don't lose your face anymore! |
6639|Princess Sharosa: Traitor! Stop it! |
6640|Raultras said weakly: I...absolutely...will not...betray you...you will know soon...|
6641|Man dressed as Toledo soldier: here they are! Come here soon! |
6642|Fredri: Tsk! I ran into it just after I finished talking. Everyone, be careful and try to delay them! |
6643|Fredri: Son of Eternity, here we hold on, please move forward to find the whereabouts of the king as soon as possible! |
6644|Woman in gorgeous clothes: Oh, come and help, the king is in danger! |
6645|Woman in gorgeous clothes: Ah, this adventurer, may I ask...Are you here to save us? |
6646|Queen Elaine: Come on! Noble son of eternity, I will show you where the king is. |
6647|You didn't encounter any obstacles along the way, which makes you feel very weird, but the queen didn't say anything, just kept going fast. |
6648|A man suddenly appeared in the dark cave. Could it be King Monette? Go and check while being careful around. |
6649|King Monette: Is it... Son of Eternity? |
6650|Finally breathed a sigh of relief after you discovered that the man is really a king, but suddenly a powerful force from another world binds you, this force is much stronger than the previous Frederic exerted on you, It even makes you breathless. |
6651|King Monette: No! Sidana! You cannot do this to the Son of Eternity! |
6652|The woman who originally thought to be Queen Brad was shrouded in a weird light, and then showed her true colors. |
6653|Sidana: Monette... This person also came to take you away from me. This alone is enough to make him die several times...|
6654|King Monette: Sidana, the Son of Eternity is here to help us. We must stop the terrible plan your people are carrying out. I must not let my country face such a terrible catastrophe. |
6655|Sidana: That is the country of "you". Compared with the people of "my", which side do you think I should help...|
6656|King Monette: You should help people! If your plan is successful, countless innocent lives will die tragically in that disaster. Is that what you like to see? |
6657|Sidana turned her head and smiled sadly: In fact, I have never cared about other people, I only need you... Monette... If your kingdom is gone, you will be with me forever... |
6658|King Monette trembled angrily: No... Sidana... If that happens... I will go with my kingdom... I will go with Irina who was killed by you...|
6659|Sidana was furious: Do you dare to tell me Tielyn! It was you who told me that it was just a political marriage, and you didn't love her at all! You say you love me! |
6660|King Monette said with tears in his eyes: Even now I will still say so! But, she is my wife, the queen of Brad! It is my responsibility to this kingdom! There is still a chance now! Sidana, help us stop your tribe's plans! I beg you...|
6661|Sidana raised her hand to imprison Monette and said: She is just a corpse now... Monette. We still have a long time to talk to our heart's content. Maybe you can sing a little song or say something funny like before to coax me instead of saying everything that annoys me. |
6662|Sidana turned to you and said softly: Now I have to solve this more annoying thing first. What~ Son of Eternity, are you trying to break free from my bondage to you? |
6663|Sidana smiled beautifully: You can say it earlier~ I will help you untie it... so that you can go to another world! |
6664|Sidana's hands suddenly burst out with a violent light, and the gesture is about to be released to you. |
6665|King Monette: Sidana! ! ! ! No! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |
6666|Xidana: What! who is it! |
6667|Raultras said sadly: Mother, it's me...|
6668|Sidana said angrily: Raul Tris! When are you going to disobey me! You and your stupid little group have long been targeted by others, do you think you can really stop this project! |
6669|Raultras: Mother, we must prevent that from happening! Now with the help of the Son of Eternity, we can definitely do it! |
6670|Xidana: Enough! Do you think all this can be concealed from that adult? He promised and helped our people to end the thousands of years of drifting and return to this world. This is only a small price. |
6671|Raultras: Mother, we can find other ways to solve the matter of the tribe, but the people of the Breed Kingdom can't be resurrected after they die! |
6672|King Monette: Sidana, stop...while things still have room for change...|
6673|Sidana's face sank: Every one of you is like this, all of you will defy me, obviously you can't do anything...|
6674|Sidana waved her hands, and Raultras and King Monette immediately fell in pain. |
6675|Sidana continued sullenly: But here she said something that didn't help. Our goal has been achieved long ago. Now the ancient kingdom of Dorrent has crossed the alien world and came to this world. As long as the preparations are completed, it will be able to land in the city of Felihaiwo. |
6676|King Monette's eyes were round and trembling, panting and speechless.
Raul Tris struggled and said: How come... the plan shouldn't... start now...|
6677|Sidana: I said that your small group has long been targeted, Raultras, everything you do is in vain. When you leave the city of Philip Hayward from the army, the kingdom of Brad is doomed to be destroyed Up. |
6678|Sidana gave a crazy smile: But it doesn't matter, our family... are all reunited... what will happen outside, it has nothing to do with us. |
6679|Sidana: Ah~ I almost forgot... There is an outsider here... Son of Eternity, knowing that countless people are about to die in disasters but cannot be saved, it must be very uncomfortable for you... Let me help you solve this Pain...|
6680|Sidana's words stimulated you, and you feel that a huge power suddenly emerges in your body to help you resist the power of another world. |
6681|Sidana: Oh? Do you still have the strength to struggle? What a pity... You wouldn't have felt the pain and you could die easily...|
6682|You have completely broken the shackles of the power of the outside world through the power in your body and restored your own actions. |
6683|Sidana burst out with weird energy and angrily said: Hmph... Just do your senseless resistance! |
6684|Sidana: Uh...uh...what's going on...|
6685|The energy that enveloped Sidana suddenly disappeared out of thin air. She made a painful voice and then fell weakly, and the power of the otherworld that had bound the king and Raultras also disappeared at this time. |
6686|King Monette: Sidana!
Lauertres: Mother! |
6687|Sidana said painfully and weakly: Monette...Raultras...I...we were all deceived...that person...somehow...makes us all crazy...and accepts...his manipulation...|
6688|Sidana said in a barely audible voice: I'm sorry...you have to...well...live on... |
6689|After speaking the last words, Sidana's body finally disappeared, and King Monette stood up resolutely. Although there were still tears on his face, his face had returned to his previous firmness. |
6690|King Monette: Raultras, you have been working hard for you all the time. In order to continue to hide your identity as a foreigner, you are willing to endure so much criticism and continue to help the Brad empire. I should have discovered it earlier. |
6691|Raultras said sadly: But father...I failed...I was so arrogant that I could stop the tribe's plan on my own...but in the end...I couldn't even save my mother. |
6692|King Monette: We don't have time to grieve everywhere. Raultras, you must now tell me everything you know, and let me know how serious the situation is. |
6693|Raultras: Yes, father. As my mother said, now the floating continent has crossed from another world to this world, and we originally thought it would take a while before it started. |
6694|Raultras: What happened recently was done by aliens trying to lead Brad's army out of the city of Philip Hayward. They disguised themselves as the Toledo Empire and carried out various provocations, while the meteorite was traveling through space. A small island that fell when it lost power. |
6695|Raultras: I think we must now bring the army back to the city of Philip Hayward, because the aliens must cast a magic circle on the ground to make the floating continent land completely, we have to stop themComplete the magic circle. |
6696|King Monnet: Okay, I will go back to mobilize the army, but I want you to lead your organization to find a way to board the floating continent immediately. |
6697|Raultras: Yes, father. |
6698|King Monette sincerely said to you: Son of Eternity... Without your help, the Kingdom of Bradd might be destroyed... I am here to ask you to continue to assist us. |

6708|Raultras: Pei Sharosa, son of eternity! You are all here, great. Regarding the next actions of the aliens, we have grasped the general situation...|
6709|Raultras: Pei Sharosa, what does this mean... Do you still want to treat me this way? |
6710|Princess Pei Sharosa: We are committed to fighting against aliens, and you seem to belong to one of them, how do I know that you are not leading us into a trap. |
6711|Raultras: Stop getting angry, Pei Sharosa! Didn't Father have explained to you clearly -|
6712|Princess Pei Sharosa:-Your father will also make mistakes, Raul Triss, your birth and my mother's death both confirm this. |
6713|Raultras: You are not the only one who lost his mother, Pei Sharosa. What we should do now is to let the Kingdom of Brade survive this crisis safely! |
6714|Princess Pei Sharosa: Indeed, you can agree that driving away aliens is our top priority. If you still have the slightest nostalgia for the Kingdom of Brade, return to your clan now and tell them to stop all destructive actions. |
6715|Raultres: You are simply unreasonable, Pei Sharosa. |
6716|Princess Pei Sharosa: I really have nothing to say to those who invade the homeland. |
6717|Raultras: Enough! I am here to seek help, not to establish an enemy. |
6718|Raultras: If there are any reasonable people here, he must know that the summoning rituals in the city of Philip Hayward are all bait, and their real plan will be carried out in the city near the floating continent. , The most important thing at the moment is to find out that place as soon as possible. (Laurtres turns his head after looking at you)|
6719|Princess Pei Sharosa: Hmph, if it weren't for them, Philly Hayward wouldn't face the current miserable situation. |
6720|Princess Pei Sharosa said loudly: Stop being sneaky, come out and end it! |
6721|Alien Surgeon: So have you noticed it a long time ago... Humph! Forget it, the result is the same, we are going to make a decision! |
6722|Princess Pei Sharosa: Don't bother to talk about it anymore, even if you let the horse come, it is impossible for these people to catch me. |
6723|Alien Surgeon: You? No... We want Raul Tris, where did you hide him? Speak out, we can spare you from dying. |
6724|Princess Pei Sharosa: ...what do you want him to do? Isn't he always with you aliens who invade other people's homes? |
6725|Alien Surgeon: Hmph, I don't know what tricks you guys are playing, we did see Raul Tris walk in here...or say...|
6726|Alien spellcaster: Damn it! We lost it again! This cunning traitor, I said we have to deal with the watchman before we start planning! |
6727|Alien spellcaster: Retreat, leave these people alone, they can cause no threat. |
6728|Pei Xia Luosha: Do you want to go? I won't let you go! |
6729|Alien spellcaster: Tsk! This woman is so annoying! Since you are so determined to find death, I will send you back to nothingness! |
6730|Alien Surgeon: Don't, don't be proud...I will send someone to find you... You better be careful...|
6731|Princess Pei Sharosa looked at the wounded soldiers in trouble, and sighed in distress. |
6732|Prince Carumbair: Son of Eternity, you finally came, these aliens really laid a lot of traps, we have lost several soldiers on the way here...their sacrifice will never be in vain...|
6733|With the sound of fast running footsteps coming into your ears, when you look back, Princess Pei Sharosa appears in front of you with an anxious look on her face. |
6734|Princess Pei Sharosa: Karum Baier! Your soldiers...out there...we have to go back and save them! |
6735|Prince Karumbair: No! Pei Sharosa, there is no time. We have to destroy their summoning ceremony here as soon as possible. Only by doing so can we really rescue the soldiers from the crisis. move! |
6736|Princess Pei Sharosa went forward with Calumbaer without saying a word. |
6737|You and your party arrived in front of the main hall of the Senate, only to find that the dead watchers were all around, and you also found the dying Raul Tris among them. |
6738|Princess Pei Sharosa: Oh my god...this...this is...what's going on...|
6739|Prince Karumbair: Be careful! The person who did this is still nearby. Don't take it lightly! |
6740|There is still a heavy and terrifying atmosphere around, no matter who caused the tragedy, he must confirm the situation of Raul Tris as soon as possible before he returns. |
6741|Stranger Man: Hahaha, hahahaha! It's really fun to hide in the dark and watch you panic, and it's not worth it that I have been here for so long. |
6742|Stranger Man: Son of Eternity, we meet again. The defeat in the Toledo Empire reminds me from time to time that I must revenge against you. Do you know how much effort I have put in today? |
6743|A familiar feeling quickly surfaced in your mind, and you blurted out: You are... Troframu! |
6744|Troframu: Yeah! (Troframu raises both hands to release the energy of the otherworld with the destructive power, and at the same time confines the three of you to the ground)|
6745|Princess Pei Sharosa: Uh...what's going on...
Prince Karumbair: Why...I can't resist...|
6746|Troframu: Of course! This is a brand new power that I have gained after arriving in another world. This power is very compatible with the power of destruction. Even if I want to pull a piece of land from the sky, it is not impossible, hahahahaha. |
6747|Princess Pei Sharosa: You can't do this!
Prince Karumbair: Damn...just move me...|
6748|Troframu: Haha, just kidding. But it is a pity that you will not be able to live to see the beauty of this castle destroyed by the fallen continent. |
6749|Troframu: Because you will be its food, um...it should be said to be an appetizer. After all, this castle is full of people, so it shouldn't go hungry. |
6750|Troframu: Then goodbye forever! Son of Eternity, you may have been a natural enemy of my generation, but before this new power, you were nothing, hahahahahaha. |
6751|Prince Carumbair: Are we really going to die here? I, I am not willing to...|
6752|Princess Pei Sharosa: Don't give up! Even if you die...can't give up! |
6753|Under the looming crisis, you suddenly felt an unusually familiar wave of fluctuations in the depths of your consciousness. You touched that power in your heart without thinking about it, and the power of the blue crystal, which symbolizes hope, instantly fills you. After absorbing the energy of the outside world that imprisoned you, it swelled out. |
6754|Go! Use the power of this blue crystal that resonates with otherworldly energy to knock down the huge monsters that come! |
6755|Prince Carumbair: You did it... I really don't know how to thank you... Son of Eternity. |

6797|Troframu: Even if I am as powerful as I am, I will still be afraid of the warlocks of the Dorrent Kingdom. If I confront you head-on, I have no chance... For this reason, I choose to infiltrate you, bear with me, and Looking forward to the joy of betrayal. |
6798|Troframu: Ah~ finally proves that my patience is valuable. To ruin an ancient kingdom with one's own strength, I believe that even the most outstanding powerhouses of our generation, few can have such an experience. |
6799|Troframu: But these are only small rewards compared to my real purpose. Let's just say, my noble Queen, what kind of secret is there on the floating light ladder, which is said to have no end? |
6800|Queen Nosalena: You! How could you know what's on the Holy Land|
6801|Troframu: Oh! To find out, the person who is asking the question is unfortunately me, and the only thing that comes out of your mouth is the answer...or howling. |
6802|Dorolila: No! You cannot treat Her Majesty like this! |
6803|Queen Nosalena: I... even if I... die... I won't... tell you... anything... ahem...|
6804|Troframu suddenly stopped torturing the Queen. |
6805|Troframu: Ah! That's right, if Her Majesty is dead, I really don't know how to climb the Floating Light Ladder. |
6806|Troframu: But other people are not so important, right? Your honorable queen. |
6807|Dorolila: Uhhhhhhh! |
6808|Queen Nosalena: Dolorila! You...Troframu...you the most despicable being...|
6809|Troframu: Thanks and praise! Oh, there seem to be many unused lives in this palace, and they will bloom beautiful flowers of pain in front of your eyes one by one. |
6810|Queen Nosalena is about to end her life, but she is immediately imprisoned by Troframu's power and cannot move. |
6811|Troframu: Don't worry~ my good queen, as long as you reveal all the information I need, you can continue to complete what you just wanted to accomplish. |
6812|Troframu suddenly tilted his head as if he was sensing something, and a shuddering smile appeared on his face. |
6813|Troframu: Ha, another little fish of the watchman has also been hooked. I'm very sorry, Your Majesty. I have to go down and deal with some pleasant things first, butGentleman, like I will not let you wait too long, please wait a moment. |
6814|Troframu opened the portal and disappeared after speaking. |
6815|Troframu: Haha... we still have to say it in the end, why waste so much of our time, Your Majesty? |
6816|Troframu: Alright~ Now that I have got the information I want, I will be merciful to save your lives, so that you can open your eyes and watch the fall of the great Dorent Magic Kingdom. |
6817|Troframu: That beautiful view...but it is absolutely unforgettable...hehe...maybe this is something that everyone who is a part of the scenery can't experience...|
6818|Troframu: What, son of eternity! How could you be alive! |
6819|You said out loud that you came to stop him. |
6820|Troframu sneered: If I were you, I would escape as far as possible...but I didn't expect you to come and die by yourself. |
6821|Troframu: Well, no matter how many times you come back, the result will be the same. It just so happens that I have a new toy here. I think you will be very interested in him. |
6822|Raultras walked out of the dark and launched a fierce attack on you without saying a word. |
6823|Troframu: How? After all, those who resist the Son of Destruction will have two ends, surrender or death! But you, the Son of Eternity, must be the latter, hahahaha. |
6824|Raultras: Woo...Where is this...I...My head...|
6825|Raultras: Son of Eternity, please...Kill me...I can't...control...self...self... anymore...|
6826|Troframu: Yes ~ Son of Eternity! Kill him soon! Kill this idiot who worked hard to stop my plan, just like what I'm waiting to do on you. |
6827|The resonance of blue crystals and otherworldly energy that broke through the imprisonment emerged in your body. You released it without thinking, breaking through the imprisonment imposed by the Son of Destruction on Raultras and other Dorrents. |
6828|Tropharam said in surprise: You can even use this power! Hum...You won't be arrogant for long anyway... Son of Eternity... After I get the power of Alnaferloti... You are all dead! |
6829|Trofram angrily leaves by teleporting magic. |

6900|Troframu: Hehe, isn't this the Son of Eternity? I expected you to come here to find your own way. |
6901|Troframu: Maybe if you come earlier, I will worry that my great plan will be blocked by you again, but now... your existence is no longer a threat to us! Hahahaha! |
6902|Troframu: The energy here is pure and powerful, and it is effortless to extract. Although going back to the past will consume a lot of energy, but I think it is more than enough to separate a little bit to solve you...Hahaha...|
6903|Troframu: It has always been your stupid sense of justice that plunged yourself into death, but that's the end, Son of Eternity. Let me think about what kind of entertainment you can provide us at the end of your humble life...|
6904|Troframu: Ah~ I thought about it, you always take your group of... the so-called righteous men to defeat my companions. Now...it's time for you to taste...being besieged...|
6905|Troframu: Go! Kill this lonely stupid, if you can't handle even an eternal son, you will be in vain! |
6906|Troframu: Humph! Waste, good death. |
6907|Troframu: Ha! Another rubbish. |
6908|After knocking down all the sons of destruction, you looked at Troframu with a firm look, and he looked back at you with extremely angry eyes. |
6909|Troframu: Do you think...you can really get out of here alive? You just killed the most useless ones in my generation...|
6910|Troframu: Now...Go to hell! ! ! |
6911|Troframu releases a terrible force of destruction to press on you, you use your whole body to resist, and the force of eternity gathers a barrier in front of you. |
6912|Troframu: Stop struggling! You can't resist me who has absorbed the energy of the outside world from the Holy Land! |
6913|Troframu: Hahaha! Son of Eternity... I really can't figure out how you have blocked our plans all the time, you are now... so... weak! |
6914|The boundless darkness presses you to the ground, and the heavy pressure presses out all the air in your chest. You are trembling to find any way to reverse this situation, but you can only feel the weakness and right in your heart Fear of failure. |
6915|Troframu slowly walks towards you: Finally! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! The Son of Eternity was finally defeated by me! Soon, your companions will have the same fate as you, and eternity will eventually end and destruction will come! Hahahahahaha! |
6916|Troframu: Death will not come to you too soon, Son of Eternity, before that, you will be suffering in purgatory, confessing the stupidity that obstructed our plan, until death, your soul Can't escape the abyss of pain! |
6917|Troframu: Farewell, Son of Eternity, but this world will be with you soon...Hahahaha...|
6918|Raultras: No! I won't let you do this! ! ! (A black figure quickly crashes into Troframu's arms|
6919|Troframu: You! ! ! you! ! ! ! Bastard! ! ! ! ! ! |
6920|Raultras: Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh! go in! You are the one going to purgatory! |
6921|Troframu: Go away! ! ! Do not! ! ! ! ! I have defeated the Son of Eternity! ! ! You can't stop me! ! ! ! ! you can not! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |
6922|Raultras turns his head and smiles at you: Son of Eternity, goodbye...|
6923|Troframu: No! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! (The roaring voice of the Son of Destruction echoes in the space, but both his and Raultres have been swallowed up by the closed purgatory gate.|
6924|You stood up trembling, and your whole body was aching from the battle just now, but your consciousness still stayed on what happened just now. You slowly noticed where Raul had disappeared in the gate of Purgatory. The sword used by Tracy. |

6966|The nearby swamp exudes a heinous and evil air, this breath gradually erodes the body, and its own strength seems to be weakened a lot. |
6967|A black shadow swiftly ran away from him, before he could see that the black shadow had disappeared. |
6968|As the shadow fades away, the evil spirit that entangles oneself also disappears. |
6969|As the flame burns, the body gradually feels uncomfortable, so it seems better to be careful. |
6970|As Triunes fell, he suddenly felt a strong murderous intent emanating from not far away (305, 327). |
6971|With the death of Drake, the roar of sea beasts came from the depths, and the screams were full of sadness and anger. |
6972|After you confirmed the death of the sea beast, you heard the quarrels and fights coming from the port. |
6973|Troframu: Hahaha! You finally appeared in front of me! But you don't have to struggle anymore! Diazas! |
6974|Diasas: My head...so dizzy...you guy, what did you do to me? |
6975|Troframu: Just inject my dark power into your body, ah! It seems that the effect is pretty good~ Enjoy this wonderful gift! |
6976|Diassas: .............No.......So uncomfortable......|
6977|Troframu: Hahaha! Isn't it so fast? Is there an impulse to destroy everything |
6978|Diassas: Don't want to succeed! Even if the fire of life goes out, I will not obey you at any mercy. |
6979|(In an instant, Diassas' eyes changed, and he began to roar crazily, and several black flames burst out of his body and burned.)|
6980|Troframu: Would you rather be devoured by magic than destroy everything? Damn it, it seems I can only look for other powerful creatures. |
6981|The flame that devours life has ignited, and another flame will ignite after 20 seconds. After the ten flames that devour lives are ignited, they will devour all lives. |
6982|The third flame will be activated in 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6983|The fourth flame will be activated in 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6984|The fifth flame will be activated in 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6985|The sixth flame will be activated in 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6986|The seventh flame will be turned on after 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6987|The eighth flame will be turned on after 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6988|The ninth flame will be turned on after 20 seconds. After the ten life-swallowing flames are ignited, all lives will be devoured. |
6989|The last flame will be activated after 20 seconds, devouring all lives. |
6990|All the devouring fires have ignited, and the gates of hell are about to open! |
6991|(A very wide range of weird flames that slowly rise from the floor)|
6992|(People around you will be affected by the fire of hell, taking 13000 points of damage every 5 seconds.)|
6993|(Drake is calling the pirates to come over and erect the star-crystal barrier)|
6994|(The star-crystal barrier has been erected, and Drake will restore 42,000 stamina every second, and greatly increase all resistances. One of the crystals needs to be destroyed before the barrier can be lifted)|
6995|(The star-crystal barrier has been shattered, and Drake's buffs have been completely removed.)|
6996|Winster was about to spit bubbles into the surrounding area, and was attacked by the bubbles until he would be frozen. |
6997|Winster: "Obviously he has bestowed great power to rebirth the master again, but why has the master been wiped out again!"|
6998|The Holy Spirit is casting the "Counter-Summoning Enchantment". Please prevent the "Fallen Gospel Angel" from approaching. The spell will be completed in 1 minute. |
6999|The "Counter Summoning Enchantment" was forced to stop, and the Holy Spirit released the accumulated energy and solved all the "fallen gospel angels" around. |
7000|Please talk to Le May (375,50) again and let the Holy Spirit cast the spell again. |
7001|A strong light emerged, the Holy Spirit successfully performed the "Counter-Summoning Enchantment" and the "Fallen Gospel Angel" no longer appeared. |
7002|Holy Spirit: Son of Eternity, we will cast "Breaking Demon Enchantment" around, please take advantage of the gap to attack him. |
7003|The holy spirits are performing "Break the Demon Enchantment". Bringing <Abyss Angel Statue> Moreau into the enchantment can temporarily destroy the effect of the "Holy Shield". |
7004|Holy Spirit: "Very well done, thank you for your help, Son of Eternity. Then the fallen gospel angels will not appear again."

Rosser: "It's done beautifully, I have to go back and tell everyone the good news."|
7005|Holy Spirit: "Son of Eternity, we sensed a powerful and chaotic wave of magical power in the southwest (257, 61). Can you please help to investigate?"|
7006|The Holy Spirit: "We have to close the dimensional passage of the "fallen gospel angels" here.|
7007|The holy spirits are using the "immovable enchantment" and are not affected by the "magic circle fluctuation" within the enchantment range. |
7008|Holy Spirit: "Oops, the forbidden totem will weaken our power. If we don't destroy it, we can't maintain the "immovable enchantment"." |
7009|The forbidden totem shoots a different light and destroys it, destroying all the "immovable barriers" of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will re-open the "immovable barriers" after resting. |
7010|Freddy slowly fell to his knees while his face and body shape gradually changed, revealing a similar face. |
7011|Fudimo: "Hahahahaha, it's too late, it's too late, you can't stop it!"|
7012|LeMay: "This..., Son of Eternity, he is not Freddie, but Freddie's brother Fredmore!"|
7013|As Fudimo fell, the ritual to lift the seal was finally completed, and the earth shook, so go to (147,290) to check. |
7014|Le May: "Sorry, I'm a step late, it seems that the seal has been unlocked, we are coming (147,290) to take a look!"|
7015|The seal has been completely shattered, and the Holy Spirit Beast slowly appeared in front of everyone, and this alone has already made people feel extremely oppressed. |
7016|Suddenly, the size of the holy beast is getting smaller quickly, but you can feel all the power instantly concentrated. |
7017|The Holy Spirit: "Son of Eternity, this is the full picture of our King of the Holy Spirit, but now we have no strength to fight him."|
7018|Calgadis: "It's...enough, my compatriots, don't have to defend them anymore, let me...end it all!"|
7019|Holy Spirit: "Son of Eternity, the king's power is too strong for us to fight against, but if his power is over-expanded, there may be flaws."|
7020|Winster: "Didn't it say that this power is inferior to the Son of Eternity? Why is that?"|
7021|Winster: "No matter what, I must take revenge! No one can stop in front of me!"|
7022|Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh~~~ I can't control myself! Son of Eternity, please stop me! |
7023|Along with the rupture of the guardian crystal of the Cape, Diassas' defense has also dropped significantly. |
7024|Weird rays of light emerged from the holy spirit beast, and the eyes of the holy spirit beast gradually became clear with the screaming noise. |
7025|Finally, the weird light disappeared, and the Holy Beast fell tiredly, but you can already see the harmless kindness in his eyes. |
7026|Voice of Mystery: "Hahahaha, Son of Eternity, this time I want to thank you! If you hadn't defeated this stupid horse, I really don't know how to subdue him!"|
7027|The body of the Holy Beast gradually dissipated into flowing energy in front of everyone, and drifted slowly in the same direction. |
7028|Holy spirits: "Damn it, don't want to control my king again!" (Sounds in unison)|
7029|The Voice of Mystery: "What else can you do now? Hahaha...Huh?"|
7030|O Ruofi: "Uh! Everyone has something to say, don't look like eating people...hey...hey...help...help!"|
7031|The Son of Destruction ran away quickly and looked around in the guillotine! (From the radar map (M) to confirm the possible location of the son of destruction)|
7032|Ou Ruofei: "Damn it! Why are there even here? What kind of ghost wall is this!"|
7033|The Son of Destruction seems to be looking for the loopholes in the Holy Spirit barrier, look around in the guillotine! (From the radar map (M), the possible location of the son of destruction can be confirmed)|
7034|Ou Ruofei: "Relax, relax, sit down and talk about something! Hehe...hehe, huh?"|
7035|Ou Ruofei: "It's you, little guy, let you see the power of the red crystal with the power of the Holy Beast!...Why is the dialogue a bit old-fashioned?"|
7036|The red crystal in the hands of the Destruction Child continuously releases the energy of purple, red and black, and it quickly concentrates on the "valley lizard". |
7037|Ou Ruofei: "That's it, grow up a little bit! Hahahaha, huh?"|
7038|O Ruofi: "Wait...wait, that's enough, wow~~~! Out of control!"|
7039|The power of the holy beast seems to be beyond the ability of ordinary creatures, and the power begins to overflow out of control, blasting a gap in the barrier laid by the holy spirits. |
7040|Ou Ruofei: "Huh? Did you make the gap?...Ha...Hahaha, everything is as expected, Son of Eternity, you will take care of the rest!"|
7041|A helpless voice suddenly came into my mind: "Please... who can help me... Let me be free from this endless darkness..."|
7042|The Son of Destruction set several red crystals around, and the endless power of destruction is constantly gushing out! You have to stop it quickly, otherwise the power of destruction will make the monster stronger! |
7043|Son of Eternity, thank you for your help, free me from the darkness. |
7044|The "fallen gospel angels" constantly gushing from the depths of the guillotine block in front of you. Go to the entrance (377, 47) and ask Le May to see what you can do! |

7108|Mrs. Kelly: "As you can see, the entire Rose Manor is full of institutions, and with the looming mysterious phantom, we can't enter the manor at all."|
7109|Mrs. Kelly: "Please, I can only rely on you now, please help us catch these prisoners who have escaped from prison!"|

7197|Toledo III: "Forget it! God of destruction! Give me infinite power to defeat this group of foreign enemies!"|
7198|At the same time, the surrounding souls turned into four flames of different colors, and Toledo III was suspected of gaining a special power, which looked particularly powerful. |

Melonite: "Like this monster with a hot body, the "ice" magic is their nemesis.|
7321|Mellonet: "Very good, now you have to test your judgment and reaction ability, wait a while I will release more monsters, use the magic just learned to defeat them."|
7322|Melonette: "You did a great job, Yonezuru, that's all for today's teaching, let's play!"|
7323|Mellonet: "When I attack you with fireball, use "Elemental Silence" to counteract my magical attack.|
7324|Melonet: "Next, when the local servants or Emis are attacked by fireballs, they use the "Elemental Barrier" and move to them to counteract the magical attack. |
7325|Mellonet: "Finally, when you suffer a life-threatening attack, use the "Ice Coffin" to be immune to all damage.|
7326|Just after you "read" the two books on the introduction of magic, you heard the loud shout of <Guardian Elder> Yinglong!
Yinglong: "Oh my God! What did these two fools do!"|
7327|Go to the door of the library (239, 70) and ask <Guardian Elder> Yinglong what happened. |
7328|Use the skills granted by the "force field magic" state to reach Loren's location (53, 142) through the gravity trap.
Note: When flying into the air, you cannot use the skill "Quadrant Crossing" to cancel the effect of the "Death Field". |
7329|After you find Loren, immediately use force field magic to maintain the twisted force field around you. A few seconds later, the gravity traps are all lifted. |
7330|Go to the front hall of the palace (48, 73) and talk to Loren. |
7331|Loren unfolds the magic circle, Xiaoqi and Daxing transfer the magic power of the golden wand to the "Monster Seal Record". |
7332|After the white light passed, the phantom of the book disappeared without a trace. |
7333|Knock down the dark dragon to protect everyone's safety.
Loren: "Son of Eternity, although I am embarrassed, this monster is not something we can deal with. I will trouble you again."|
7334|As soon as you enter the corridor, you feel that the surrounding space is distorted, but nothing happens. |
7335|You feel that the space around you is distorted again, which makes you dizzy and you are already in front of the corridor when you open your eyes. |
7336|Suddenly, you are stopped by the mercenary group behind you. |
7337|You expressed your identity and what Mo Yan explained. |
7338|I've heard Mrs. Nady talk about your affairs with Nady, but I didn't expect you to get out of that whole body. |
7339|In this case, you may have to find the best dancer in our city "Lismi", but... |
7340|He doesn't want to be disturbed when he is practicing dance, so there will be soldiers around to prevent you from approaching her. |
7341|Those soldiers are different from ordinary soldiers, they are all excellent soldiers carefully selected by him, even I dare not approach him rashly when he is practicing dance. |
7342|Let's do it! You bring this power to find him, I think she might want to talk to you. |
7343|As long as you know the trick, I have a way to wake up your sleeping power! |
7344|In this case, you may have to risk finding the cursed guitar "Dream". |
7345|It is said that those who can conquer the "Nightmare" can awaken the sleeping soul and allow themselves to perform magically. |
7346|But... this guitar will eat the unsteady soul of the bard and make that person fail to play for life. |
7347|According to my information, the person who has conquered the "Nightmare" is in the city, and that person is called "Special Servant Lela". |
7348|Let's do it! You take this power to find it, I think in this way you can still retain a trace of the soul of the bard. |
7349|I believe you! You will be able to perform the best performance! |
7350|Why is it noisy outside? Guard! Guard! |
7351|Patient...you...I have never seen such a shining soul of dancing! |
7352|You don't know what the soul of dance is? That is the realm passed down among our dancers! |
7353|There is only one way to master the soul of dance! It is to believe in the dance steps you dance, which is your heart! |
7354|Just relax, close your eyes and imagine yourself walking in the sky, that's right! Just like you are now! |
7355|(You feel your body lighten up slowly, as if you are enjoying dancing in a fairyland.)|
7356|As long as it is matched with the music rhythm, I believe it will be the most beautiful performance! |
7357|Okay~ I can't be caught up by you! Let's go back and continue dancing, goodbye. |
7358|There seems to be a concert ahead, so let's watch it here for now. |
7359|Suddenly the surrounding atmosphere became very strange, and I felt the statue in front tremble. |
7360|A roar cut through the sky and disrupted the music being played. |
7361|Suddenly a huge monster ran out of the statue. |
7362|I...want to...eat...everything! ! |
7363|Please defeat this huge monster in front of you. |
7364|It turns out that the legend is true. When playing the nightmare, without the glory of playing in the heart, it will attract the devil to eat his unsteady soul. |
7365|Look at your breath, it should be for the nightmare, right? But I won't give it to you. |
7366|Because this nightmare is a very horrible guitar. As long as you hesitate during the performance, those things will happen just now, so I think it would be better to destroy it. |
7367|In addition, an excellent bard, regardless of whether the guitar is good or bad, can play a heart-stringing melody. |
7368|I can see that there is such a bardic soul in your body, but you can't get rid of the restraint of this performance, and then achieve a magical performance. |
7369|Okay, not much to say, I will destroy this nightmare first, come on! The young bard. |
7370|The researcher in front should be Mo Yan said, let's see what he is doing nearby first! |
7371|Suddenly the flowers began to change. |
7372|Nady walked to the flower to confirm the change. |
7373|Flowers attacked Nadi, and Nadi fell as a result. |
7374|Mrs. Naidi immediately ran away from here. |
7375|Suddenly there was a loud voice, and you felt something hit your body. |
7376|Mo Yan: "Well, I just used some techniques to force out a little power in you. I don't know how you feel now?"|
7377|Mo Yan: "I contacted researcher Naidi, who once providedI force the energy in my body in many ways, but the palm just now should be able to force all the energy out of your body, but it seems that something is blocking it.|
7378|Mo Yan: "You will find him first, and I will find other ways to drive the energy in your body."|
7379|Stop! who are you? How dare you come here all the way! |
7380|When you were about to explain your own affairs, you were stopped by the Captain of the Guard: "Enough! You don't need to say it!"|
7381|It seems you don't plan to leave from here! Then don't blame me for being impolite! |
7382|Come out! The proudest guard! Eliminate this intruder! |
7383|If you want to find Lismi during dance practice, step on us first! |
7384|Brothers! on! |
7385|Master Ayan: The new year will come in five minutes. Let us toast to the Holy Emblem City (446, 409) to celebrate! |
7386|Master Ayan: Let us welcome 2014 with delicacies and delicacies. Hope the new year is a good year, cheers! |
7387|Barobas: "Is it finally here? I've been waiting for you for a long time!"|
7388|Barobas: "Be careful of the attack of the iron ball in front of you, and use your power of awakening."|
7389|Prepare for the game! The players are in place! |
7390|Start! |
7391|<Anniversary ambassador> Peekaboo Alice: "Hehe, I am hiding somewhere in Holy Emblem City, and I found my prize. It only takes 5 minutes. Come on, everyone!"|
7392|Cickey: "You haven't passed all the record points, go back and finish the route!"|
7393|Suddenly a strange portal appeared beside the guardian elf, something seems to be happening! |
7394|You have caught the traversing monster, quickly bring it back to Sacred Emblem City and give it to <Alternate Tower Research Apprentice> Bag! |
7395|The ancient wetland has undergone wonderful changes, the ground is full of four-leaf clover, go and see what's going on! |

7398|<Elder Elf> Cosmos: "Crack~! Let's play together!!" (Cosmos appears at 180,432)|

I am Arnold, the lawyer of the Wedding Association. I have something to tell you, and I hope you can accept it bravely. A few days ago, for various reasons, your spouse filed for a unilateral divorce to me. I apologize.

Enclosed is the 250 gold compensation for divorce, please accept it. |
7445|Currently unable to process divorce applications|
7446|Tyson: "I'm sorry, Son of Eternity, this is clearly my family's matter, but we need to ask you to help us solve it."|
7447|Tyson: "As far as I dived and observed just now, all of my people are locked up in underground prisons."|
7448|Tyson: "And there are a lot of strange creatures in the torture room above, maybe they will have the key to unlock the prison."|
7449|Tyson: "However, let's wait until we are fully prepared to move on, lest... also encounter accidents."|
7450|Tyson: "This is the torture room, please be careful, there are a lot of them."|
7451|Tyson: "There are still many cells below that have not been inspected. Let's go and have a look again!"|
7452|Tyson: "Wait! There is a burnt smell on the left hand side! And this smell... also has a bloody smell, let's go over and take a look."|
7453|Tyson: "The burnt smell is getting heavier and heavier, and there is also a unique taste of my tribe mixed with it. I suddenly have an ominous premonition."|
7454|Tyson: "These eggs here... this scene... shouldn't... my people are all in these eggs!"|
7455|Tyson: "No!~~~ I will definitely save you all!"|
7456|Suddenly there was a very loud impact from another place, and there were many noisy voices. |
7457|Tyson: "This voice has a feeling of sadness, as if it is complaining about everything in the world."|
7458|Tyson: "Um... I'm sorry Eternal Son, although I really want to follow you to rescue, but... you also see the bear people behind, I can't leave my people and leave like this."|
7459|Tyson: "That sound will bother you to go over and check it alone. When I settle down the tribe, I will pass it immediately."|
7460|Tyson: "In addition, I don't know if it will be very dangerous ahead, so I transfer my strength to you, so that you can deal with the things you encounter in front of you more easily."|
7461|Tyson: "This force will absorb all negative energy, as long as the negative energy reaches a certain level, it will be released in another form."|
7462| "You guy is finally here, let's now discuss how to eliminate the huge demon right now!"|
7463|"However, before you came here, we decided to let you attract its attention, and we attacked from the side. We temporarily referred to it as the [tornado] tactics."|
7464| "I believe that as long as we can work together, this [Tornado] will be very successful, don't you think it is very simple?"|
7465|"No! Who are you! Appearing here, with a strange power on his body, he must be an accomplice of that demon, please take his life!"|
7466|"Ah! I finally remembered, it turns out...We were dead long ago, but we were too heavy when we complained, and we were invaded and controlled by the power of darkness."|
7467|"This hero, you should be the son of eternity! Thank you for freeing us from evil, but you must be careful not to focus on the enemy in front of you to avoid accidents."|
7468| "Come out! My soldiers, go and get rid of the intruder! Suddenly, there are a lot of noises above."|
7469| "Finally settled my people, but it seems that your side is also over, it's not a loss to be the son of eternity!"|
7470|"But, what kind of creatures are these? They actually exist in this place. Fortunately, it will be resolved before the disaster expands."|
7471|"This power in you seems to have reached another level. As long as you can control this energy well, I believe that fighting skills will definitely be able to go to the next level."|
7472|"You need a cell key to open the prison door."|
7473|"All the cell doors are open, let's go to the next place to have a look! I believe there are still many tribesmen who have not been rescued yet."|
7474|"Please defeat the powerful [Spirit] that appears in front of you."|
7475|"Suddenly three heavy knights ran out in front of you. Let's see what they say next to you."|

7480|10 seconds before the end of the assessment, please grasp the time. |
7481|There was a uniform loud shout from the front, and the temple knights stood on both sides of the stairs to welcome the challenger in unison. |
7482|The middle-rank male knights lined up on both sides bowed slightly and launched the offensive.
Captain of the Intermediate Male Cavaliers: It's rude! |
7483|The mid-level female knights arranged on both sides raised their swords and flattened their chests, and launched the second wave of offensive.
Captain of the Intermediate Female Cavaliers: Please advise! |
7484|The high-ranking temple knights lined up in front gallop in, lightly pulling the reins to launch the third wave of attacks.
Captain of the High Templar Knights: Concentrate on the ground! |
7485|The fourth wave of attacks is a combination of mid-level male knights and mid-level female knights. |
7486|The last wave of attacks, the high-ranking temple knights will attack with all their strength. |
7487|After the fierce attack, the Templar Knight Eddie Buddy appeared in the center of the venue and opened a portal. |
7488|The first assessment venue|
7489|A magic circle was suddenly drawn on the ground, and the entire space was immediately covered with magic particles. |
7490|At the same time that the magic circle disappeared, the examiner Faya finally appeared, and the first test officially began!
Falla: Hello, everyone, please give me your advice. |
7491|The magic circle was launched again, and the blazing fire made the entire venue sultry and unbearable. |
7492|The magic circle was activated again, and the cold frost caused the temperature to drop rapidly. |
7493|The magic circle was launched again, and the frictional electrons in the air blasted out dazzling sparks. |
7494|Successfully passed the first test, the portal to the second assessment venue has been opened, please go to the second assessment venue from the hall of the venue.
Faya: "Congratulations to you for passing my test, there are more difficult tests next, please continue to cheer."|

7496|The second assessment venue|
7497|Yugali jumped off Sara's back, and the second test officially began!

7503|Kalu: "Children, there is no time to take your time.Come out quickly!|
7504|Kalu: "Hurry up, hurry up, ah, remember to stay elegant in the hustle and bustle!"|
7505|Gia Lu: "Xiao Lu, it's you again, don't run like this... alas!"|
7506|Xiao Lu: "Ah! Lord Jialu, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll be in my position right away."|
7507|When all the Vatican medical team members are in place, Jialu puts away his flustered face, and the third level test officially begins!
Jialu: "Sorry, it's rude, then let's start right away!"|
7508|Support the little nurse: "Our mission is to make the light of treatment shine on Master Jialu!"|
7509|Emergency nurse: "Master Jialu, are you injured? Let us see!"|

7512|The third level test and challenge failed, this selection is over.
Jialu: "Children, you have worked hard, let's go back and continue class."|
7513|The fourth assessment venue|
7514|Natalie appeared in the center of the assessment venue, focusing on a defensive posture.
Nethali: "Reft, I'm ready, come on!"|
7515|Reft, holding the big crimson sword, didn't say a word, and slashed at Nethali. |
7516|A series of domineering sword auras mercilessly slashed towards Nethali, but Nethali seemed unmoved. |
7517|Finally, Reft stopped the attack, but the strong vindictiveness exuding at this time was suffocating.
Left: "Go on! Flying Dragon Slash!"|
7518|At the end of the duel exercise, Reft and Nethalie moved slowly to the center of the assessment venue.
Nethali: "Brother, your attack has improved again."     Reft: "You still can't break through your defense."|
7519|The two noticed the challengers and immediately converged their minds into a fighting pose, and the fourth level test officially began!
Nethali: "Brother, do you still have the strength?"     Left: "You can't die."|
7520|Lando: "Give a hint, defeat two examiners at the same time in order to pass the test of this level, but their recovery speed is very fast."|
7521|If Raft is not defeated within 10 seconds, Nethali will return to the battlefield to continue fighting.
Reft: "Sister, 10 seconds, up to 10 seconds."|
7522|If Nethali is not defeated within 10 seconds, Reft will return to the battlefield to continue fighting.
Nethali: "Brother, you step back first. I will help you get 10 seconds to recover your breath."|
7523|Both examiners are exhausted, and are about to give the final blow. |
7524|Successfully passed the fourth test, and the final test will be conducted in the hall of the venue.
Nethali: "Go! Everyone, don't lose easily!"      Left: "..."|
7525|The fourth level of the test failed, and this selection is over.
Natalie: "Don't be discouraged, it's not that you are too bad, but we are too strong."     Left: "Let's go! Sister."|
7526|There was little light on the ground without warning, seeming to be arranged in some kind of image. |
7527|Look carefully, the reason for the formation of the light is actually the rapid sword energy. |
7528|Like a demonstration, the formation that was supposed to be over appears a third. |
7529|After the formation completely disappeared, Odifas appeared in the center of the hall, and the final test officially began!
Audifas: "Do you remember all the formations?"|
7530|With the defeat of Odifas, Amos, the top person in charge of the joint selection, appeared in the center of the venue.
Amos: "It's amazing. Congratulations on passing all the tests."|
7531|The final test and challenge failed, and this selection is over.
Rando: "Everyone, I'm very sorry, because we have to rearrange the venue, so we brought you out directly."|

7549|Sefilo looked at Nalan, hesitated for a moment, and was about to take the holy thing out of her arms...|
7550|After Nalan said this, she pierced the dagger she was holding into her heart. |
7551|A strange force has blocked you from moving forward...|

7613|The ferocious fishermen began to destroy everywhere, and some people along the way found them coming towards the Zhuya camp (164, 117)! |
7614|The camp of Zhuya was invaded by monsters, and the crystal of the stronghold was also destroyed. |
7615|The Hoarfrost Swordsman Captain is gathering to invade Mirkala Village (455, 642) to snatch supplies! |
7616|The frequent entry and exit of the village attracted the attention of the big orcs, who assembled and invaded Mirkala Village (455, 642). |

7620|The guards of the capital of Mir Yaxiu could not resist the monsters, and the crystals in the stronghold were also destroyed. |
7621|When you finished cleaning the rope, you heard a man's weak cry for help coming towards you. |
7622|Oram: "Help...please...who...who will help me..."|
7623|Oram: "Huh?...Why are you!...Woo!" After seeing you, Oram showed a surprised expression and vomited a mouthful of blood, apparently seriously injured. |
7624|You go forward and ask him what happened. |
7625|Oram said as if unconsciously: "Bu...Brieou...ritual...stop him."|
7626|Your suspicion of Briou has been confirmed. Before dealing with him, Oram must be taken back for treatment and explained to the Chief. |
7627|There is a strong wave of magic power in front of him. It seems that Briou has already begun to destroy the ritual. Go to the ritual location (187, 345) to investigate. |
7628|You came to the ritual site looking for the source of the magical fluctuations, and you saw that Briou was casting a spell in an attempt to destroy the ritual. |
7629|"Stop!" You shouted and raised your weapon as a warning. |
7630|Brio: "You outsider, I don't have time to talk to you now, hurry up and go away." Brio continued to cast the spell ignoring your warning. |
7631|The ritual is about to be destroyed, even if you use strong means to stop Briou.
Please defeat Briou who is casting spells. |
7632|Brieu: "Damn it, do you know what you are doing!" Briou said angrily when he fell to the ground. |
7633|When you were about to say something, you suddenly couldn't move. |
7634|Oram: "I really have to thank you, Son of Eternity, or I should call you an idiot!"|
7635|Brio: "You still succeeded...who are you?"|
7636|Oram: "I? I'm not the son of the chief, the righteous Oram, and you are the villain trying to sabotage the ritual, right! The noble priest."|
7637|Brio: "Nonsense, you're not Oram...Woo!" Brio was so angry that he wanted to step forward to attack Oram, but the injuries he suffered just now made him unable to do so. |
7638|Oram: "It seems that the Son of Eternity did not put a heavy hand on you, but he can stand up, Son of Eternity, let me help you!"|
7639|Oram: "Next for you, Eternal..., forget it, I have more important things to do, there will be no deadline, hahahahahaha!"|
7640|Oram, who was about to attack you, paused and then suddenly withdrew, and the power that restricted your movement disappeared at the same time. |
7641|Brio: "Woo..." A weak, muffled sound came from behind. |
7642|Evil enemies along the way make you feel uneasy about the current situation, looking around for Oram's whereabouts but nothing. |
7643|At this time, Briou dragged his injured body to come from behind. |
7644|Brio: "Son of Eternity, don't be fooled by the spell in front of you, the enemy is indeed here." After all, Brio began to chant the spell. |
7645|When Briou successfully cracked the spell, the image in front of him was like a mirror shattered and cracked, and Oram appeared in front of the empty person. |
7646|Oram: "Strange? What's going on... It's you old fellow and you again, stupid son of eternity!"|
7647|Brio: "That's it, no matter what you are doing, you'd better stop quickly, otherwise I'm welcome!"|
7648|Oram: "Hahahahaha, can you stop me with your two trash?"|
7649|Brieou: "Oh? Is it finally time to show his true colors?" Oram's body suddenly burst into light, and you feel an unusually powerful force in him. |
7650|Brio: "Be careful, this power is not a joke!"|
7651|Oram suddenly attacked, and with a wave of his hands, he easily knocked you and Briou back. |
7652|Oram: "You guys come here over and overThing, this time I won't let you go anymore, suffer to death!|
7653|Oram: "This is? Power can't make it, who is it?"|
7654|Oram suddenly couldn't move, this is a good opportunity to knock him down.
Please defeat Oram who can't move. |
7655|As Oram fell to the ground, the weird magic light entwining him gradually dissipated. |
7656|A beautiful fairy girl appears in front of you, and the magic power you feel from her is exactly the same as the power that clamps Oram. |
7657|Fairy girl: "Two, thanks to your help, I can get rid of the shackles!"|
7658|Brio: "You...this magic, are you the tree of birth?!"|
7659|Incarnation of the Tree of Birth: "Sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. I am the Tree of Birth. What you see now is the avatar created by me to communicate with people."|
7660|Brio: "Please forgive me for being rude, great Holy Spirit, but since it's so important, can you please tell us what's going on here?"|
7661|Incarnation of the Tree of Birth: "Okay! In fact, the person you defeated has no evil thoughts, and I can feel that a force that does not belong here controls him."|
7662|The incarnation of the Tree of Birth: "The enemies who invaded aggressively all possess this special power, or they are all controlled by this power."|
7663|The incarnation of the tree of life source: "They found me quickly and took away the life energy from me, and the energy that was pumped away was taken away by another person."|
7664|The incarnation of the tree of life: "I, who wanted to stop him, were sneak attacked by this young man in a panic. The powerful restraint force made me unable to move and exert my power."|
7665|Incarnation of the Tree of Birth: "Until you appeared and fought with him, I was able to take advantage of the gap to get rid of the shackles and use my power to temporarily restrain him."|
7666|Incarnation of the Tree of Birth: "You all know what happened next."|
7667|After listening to the explanation of the incarnation of the Tree of Birth, you fell into thinking, and you remembered the fact that there was a man behind the scenes. |
7668|The tree of birth incarnation: "Two, most of my energy has been taken away, and I can't maintain the incarnation form for too long. I will leave it to the two for the next thing."|
7669|Brieu: "Wait...wait, Lord Holy Spirit!" Before Briou was finished, the mind incarnation had turned into thousands of light points and returned to the tree of birth. |

7713|Suspicious dirt shoe print|
7714|I have invited some powerful people here to help me, but no one can really hear my voice|
7715|Originally, I had given up looking for help, but I did not expect that someone who knew my identity came here through the barrier|
7716|I am the dragon god who guards this temple. Since the last turmoil of the world, my golden body and bones have been shaken out, making me gradually lose my physical strength, and at the same time, the power to protect this temple is also gradually lost. |
7717|But there is a powerful temple atmosphere in the temple. If humans who are not strong enough touch it, they will be cursed that is fatal. |
7718|A powerful human who came here and has the power of purification! Please lend me some of your strength, and I will try my best to repay it! |
7719|(Please restore the life of the Judgment Celestial Dragon, and the surrounding blood-sucking souls will absorb a large amount of the life force of the target)|
7720|Unexpectedly, there are humans who can break into here without my consent and pass through a labyrinth of traps. |
7721|Huh? This human being has such a powerful cleansing power, but... is this human willing to help me? |
7722|Human! I used to be the dragon god of the heavens, and now I am responsible for judging the good and evil of mankind. If I don't have enough cleansing power, I will not know my existence. |
7723|If you are willing to help me, then pass the next test as me! |
7724|(There are several words on the two pillars, as if they can be put together to form the identity of the dragon just now)|
7725|Thank you for your help, as long as I have these physical strength, I will be enough to hide this temple completely again. |
7726|Let me send you out next! |
7727|Jasmine: "I have placed a barrier and brought you here smoothly. Then, the next thing is left to you."|
7728|Jasmine: "There may be all kinds of dangers ahead. Even if you are the son of eternity, you must be careful."|
7729|Jasmine: "In addition, I need to rely on the pure power of your body to support the barrier, so if I am not a priest, I will be excluded."|
7730|(Please go through the maze ahead, if you get too close to the flame, you will be bounced back to the original place)|
7731|Since you are here, then you are willing to help me! There has been a lot of turbulence in the world recently, and even my golden body and bones have been shaken out by this turmoil. |
7732|As a result, I became very weak, unable to lay down the powerful enchantment of the hidden temple for a long time. I must ask someone to help me find my golden bones, the biggest being my true body. |
7733|When you picked up this bone, suddenly the bone gradually turned into a dragon and stood before your eyes, and stared at you viciously. |
7734|This should be the incarnation of a powerful idea to protect the bones. |
7735|(Please defeat the dragon spirit in front of you, let him calm down)|
7736|Unexpectedly, someone can defeat my dragon spirit incarnation. It seems that the power of purity in your body is beyond my imagination! |

7762|Varcine: "Um...it hurts!" Varcine held his head and shook it twice. |
7763|The water god summoned beast Varchene gradually wakes up. Although you can no longer feel any murderous aura, you still put on a defensive position. |
7764|Varcine: "Don't be nervous, human, I won't attack you again." After a little sober, Varcine showed kindness to you. |
7765|When you put down your weapon and were about to ask about the mysterious man, Varchene raised your hand to interrupt your question. |
7766|Varqine: "Don't worry, I have to solve the problem in Gelda village first."|
7767|Varqine chanted a spell, and the surrounding water was dancing around her as if it was alive. |
7768|A dazzling golden light radiated from her body and gradually merged into the surrounding water. |
7769|After everything settles down, Varchene holds a bottle of clear medicine in his hand. |
7770|Varqine: "Huh, this is the antidote I made with all my remaining magical powers. You take it back and drink it to the sick."|
7771|Just as Varkine was about to hand over the detoxification potion to you, a black shadow rushed past her...|
7772|The detoxification potion was shot down. Before you and Varchene hadn't reacted, a black flame burned the potion away, and at this time the shadow had disappeared without a trace. |
7773|You recognize this magic power, which convinces you that the person who caused the series of events in the highlands of ice and fire is the one who controls Oram in the realm of the sky. |
7774|Varqine growled angrily: "It's him again!"|
7775|It seems that Varchene also knows this mysterious man. You ask what happened to Varchene and why she knows that something happened in Gelda village. |
7776|Varqine: "He is a despicable guy. In order to weaken my power, he polluted the water source of the entire Gelda village, and used his dirty power to control me when I was planning to purify the water."|
7777|Varqine: "Although my consciousness is clear, my body does not listen to it, so I will fight with you."|
7778|Varqine: "Today, I have very little power left..."|
7779|Wrong cake! I used the wrong medicine and spread to myself. |
7780|It doesn't seem to be a big problem, go back and report to the farmer! |

7784|Noah: "This...this is, what did you do?"|
7785|Noah: "Oh my God! Why is it so bad? How can you explain to the top like this, oh yeah!"|
7786|Noah: "Wow!!!!!!"|
7787|Noah: "What a good thing you did! Make this super work that I carefully made."|
7788|Noah: "Who the hell are you? Break into someone else's research institute and ruin my highest masterpiece!"|
7789|When Margarella walked to Noah, and was about to ask something, Noah, who was originally angry, suddenly appeared in horror. |
7790|Noah: "You? No...impossible, it can't be him, we have already cut the time here from other places."|
7791|Noah: "Yes, it's impossible, he can't get in, but the look in his eyes is too...too like him."|
7792|After hearing Noah's murmur, you and Margarella looked at each other, and Margarella walked towards Noah again. |
7793|Margarella: "Who did you say... who is it! Also, what does it mean to cut the time and not get it back?"|
7794|Noah: "You...you...don't come over, don't look at me with that kind of eyes, Oh..."|
7795|Noah: "Woo...you..."|
7796|Margarella: "This, what's going on?"|
7797|You step forward to check and find that the magic power to kill Noah is exactly the same as the power to control Oram and break the water god's potion. |
7798|Margarella furrowed her brows, as if she was thinking about something. |
7799|Recommend! |
7800|Margarella: "That's it, why didn't you see anyone?"|
7801|Margarella: "Ah! Dermot, you are here!"|
7802|Margarella: "Demot, what's the matter with you? His face is weird."|
7803|Margarella: "Demot, you..."|
7804|Seeing Dermot's shot at Margarella, you are going to stop, but you feel suffocated in your chest and can't move. |
7805|Margarella was taken away by Demot, go back and inform Yvonne. |
7806|There seems to be fighting sounds in the library, so quickly go in (158, 85) to find out. |
7807|Woman: "Ah~~~~"|
7808|It's this familiar magic again. The man in front of you should be the culprit who caused a series of incidents. You immediately put on a fighting pose and watched the mysterious man vigilantly. |
7809|The mysterious man noticed your presence, turned around and looked fiercely, looking at you intently. |
7810|Mysterious man: "Is it finally here? Son of Eternity. Speaking of it, I don't seem to thank you well yet!"|
7811|Seeing your confused expression, the mysterious man smiled with satisfaction. |
7812|Mysterious man: "I don't understand? Then let me just say it! You stopped the nosy priest, allowing me to easily get the energy of the tree of birth."|
7813|Mysterious Man: "Later, I will use the energy of the Tree of Birth to fight against the guardian of the Water Temple and gain her power."|
7814|Mysterious Man: "With these two pure forces of nature, IIn order to smoothly open the cracks in time and space. As for the reason for opening the crack, it is not something you should know!|
7815|Mysterious man: "Do you understand this way? From beginning to end, you are just a pawn in my hand, and you have never let me down, hahahahaha!"|
7816|Women: "Woo..."|
7817|The woman who had fallen on the ground groaned a little, and the mysterious man frowned slightly and turned to look. |
7818|Mysterious man: "Tsk, it seems that I look down on you too much. He can't clean you up with a single trick. The old man in the research institute burned only bones..."|
7819|Mysterious Man: "Okay, Son of Eternity, there is nothing to do with you next. However, I don't think you will leave obediently! How about this..."|
7820|The mysterious man chanted a spell on the woman, black energy wrapped around the woman, and the woman let out a sharp scream.
Woman: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"|
7821|You want to step forward to stop it, but it is too late. The woman is full of murderous intent and her pupils are dull, standing motionless, you recognize that it was the spell that controlled Oram in the first place. |
7822|Mysterious man: "Son of Eternity, I still have important things to work on, so let her take care of you! Oh... By the way, Nati is a expertly trained warrior, you better be careful."|
7823|Margarella: "These powerful and terrifying monsters are really dangerous, what is Dermot thinking about?" Margarella looked at the monster wreck in a daze. |
7824|Dermot: "Margarella, you... why are you here? A monster invaded just now, are you all right!" Dermot showed a little panic. |
7825|Looking at Dermot's caring expression, Margarella was silent for a long time, her expression was complicated and ugly, and she wanted to stop talking. Finally, Margarella made up her mind and took a deep breath. |
7826|Margarella: "Demot, I know everything..."|
7827|Demot: "Know...what?"|
7828|Margarella: "Do you still want to lie to me? The steel weapons of the Anti-Gravity Institute, the intervention of the government, the seal of the timeline, and these...synthetic monsters, all the spearheads are directed at Greerion."|
7829|Margarella: "You have been here for so long, you must know these things, tell me, tell me you were forced."|
7830|Dermot: "Now that you know it, I will tell you! Yes, I am doing research for the government, because we have enough ability to rule the mainland."|

7839|Dermott: "As long as these synthetic creatures and Noah's steel weapons are available, it is not even a dream to rule the world!"|
7840|Dermot: "I have devoted my life to give me some more time. I promise you that after we rule the mainland, we can live happily!"|
7841|Margarella: "You...what did you say? You voluntarily...volunteer to make these dangerous and terrifying monsters!"|
7842|Dermott: "What is this, I can control them if I can make them. Although there are also failures, but now the technology has matured, there will be no more failure cases, hahahaha."|
7843|Margarella: "You!" Looking at the crazy Dermot, Margarella was speechless in surprise. |
7844|Margarella: "However, the time of Mir Yasho has stopped. We have been isolated from the outside world for how long. It is impossible to rule the mainland. Please, stop..."|
7845|Demot: "You tell that! I cut off the timeline, I have my own way."|
7846|Demot's words are like a bolt from the blue, and Margarella's mind is suddenly chaotic. It turns out that Demot knows everything, even the planner. |
7847|Mysterious man: "Have you finally said it? It is really hopeless to do biological modification for such a boring reason!"|
7848|Demot: "Who are you again?"|
7849|Mysterious man: "Don't you even recognize my voice? Brother Dermot!"|
7850|Margarella: "You! You are Owark! Where have you been these days, my sister thought you..."|
7851|Ovark: "Don't come here!" Ovark took off his cloak as he said. |
7852|Margarella: "Ovark, what happened, how did you become like this?"|
7853|Ovack: "Huh! They threatened me with your life back then, asking me to cooperate with a new research project, which is the synthetic biology you see today."|
7854|Ovark: "I had no choice but to agree. Later, in an experiment, the power of the red crystal lost control in my body, causing me to wreak havoc on the laboratory, and it also allowed me to find a gap and escape before losing my sanity."|
7855|Ovark: "Later, when the out-of-control power stabilized, I wanted to come back for revenge and to see my sister, only to find that the timeline had been cut off and I could no longer enter Mir Yasho."|
7856|Ohuake: "I searched for a long time, and found that this unnatural seal must be offset by the force of nature."|
7857|Ohuak: "So I took the power of the tree of birth source and the guardian beast of the water temple by all means, and finally succeeded in marking a gap in the seal."|
7858|Dermot: "Huh! I thought it was something wrong with my time device. It turned out that you were doing something wrong. Margarella, he is the failure case I just mentioned, but now it seems that it is likely to be The most successful one."|
7859|Margarella: "You...how can you use Ovarke to do experiments...he is a human being, not an animal! What's more, he is still my brother."|
7860|Dermot: "Because he is a human being, he meets the first conditions of this experiment. Who said Ovark's physical value is the best in the city, but it is really very difficult for him to nod and agree, so...|
7861|Margarella: "So use your relationship with me to make me a hostage and threaten Ovac to cooperate with you?"|
7862|Dermot: "Margarella, I've known you for so long, this time I'm the smartest one, but there's one thing you're wrong. It's not using our relationship, but the government sent me to get close to you to force him to submit ."|
7863|Margarella: "No, who will tell me this is not true! Uuuuu..."|
7864|Ovark: "Demot, unforgivable, I must kill you today."
Owalker: "Sister! It's dangerous here. Go to the side first!" Owalker reminded Margaria in a low voice. |
7865|While Aowak was fighting many synthetic creatures, you saw Dermot took out a dose of green solution and poured it into his arm, and then his face was trembling in place. |
7866|Ovark: "Next to you." Ovark stared at Dermot fiercely. |
7867|When Ovark was about to attack Dermot, Dermot suddenly exuded a strong aura, making it impossible to lean in. |
7868|Dermot: "Hahahahahaha, here comes, I didn't expect the effect to be so good, and the power is constantly emerging."|
7869|Ovark: "No matter what you become, I will burn you with black flames to the point."|
7870|Demot: "Try it if you can."|
7871|Aohuak: "Damn it, what a monster." Aohuak fell to the ground with serious injuries, with green blood flowing from the corner of his mouth. |
7872|Dermot: "Do you think I will do nothing and wait for you to come back and kill me? You look down on me too much, but I am ready to wait for you to snare yourself!"|
7873|Dermot: "Originally, there was a more powerful ice-bound controller hidden in my desk, but looking at you now, you probably can't resist the power of this beam gun!"
Dermot took out a beam gun and pointed it at Ovark. |
7874|Demot: "So it's over!"
Margarella: "Ovark! Don't."|
7875|At the moment when Dermot pulled the trigger, Margarella had blocked in front of Ovark, blocked Dermot's attack with her body, and dropped an instrument from her pocket when she fell to the ground. |
7876|Ohuake: "Sister, sister, no."|
7877|Dermot: "Don't worry, you will soon...Huh? What's the matter?"|
7878|Demot: "What's this? What's going on? Could it be... Margaret, you unexpectedly!"|
7879|Aohuak turned all hatred and grief into strength, and Dermot, who was the first to bear the brunt, had his legs weakened and unable to move. |
7880|Ovark: "You, I killed you!"
Dermot: "Wait...wait!"|
7881|Aohuak: "Sister, sister, how are you?" Aohuak knelt down beside Margarella and helped her who was badly injured. |
7882|Margarella: "No... I didn't expect that the device used to... deal with synthetic creatures... Since it will come in handy here... uh..." Margarella spit out a mouthful of blood with a wry smile. |
7883|Ohuake: "Sister, stop talking, hold on, you will be fine."|
7884|Margarella shook her head slightly, and tried her last strength to make a smile. You can clearly see the tears streaming down their faces. |
7885|Margarella: "Oh...Ovack, my dearest brother...you...it's so nice...to be alive." After saying this, Margaret dropped her hands weakly. |
7886|The character level needs to be 79 or higher to enter the realm of the sky. |
7887|"Suddenly the fishing rod sank, and after you pulled it up hard, a big fish monster emerged from the water."|
7888|"Just after you put down the fresh meat, an autumn brown hard-billed bird came to eat, he should be a lot."|
7889|"You shook the nine-peach tree and waited for the nine-peach fruit to fall."|

7900|Ohuake: "Sister, we are here..."|
7901|Ovark: "Son of Eternity, I'm sorry! I have brought you so much trouble. Now my revenge is over, but sister she..."|
7902|Aohuak said nothing, you can detect subtle vibrations from his sad back. |
7903|Ohuake: "Come on, the time has come." Seeing Ohuake's steadfast expression, your hesitating heart is no longer shaken. |
7904|You point the ice-sealing device at Aohuac and Margarella, take a deep breath and press the switch. |
7905|A red light burst out of Aohuak's body, and the power of the red crystal collided violently with the energy of the ice-bound instrument, causing Aohuake to utter a loud scream.
Aohuak: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"|
7906|Ohuake: "No! Don't...don't stop." Ohuake, who sees you gradually loosen the button, struggles to stop you. |
7907|The red light gradually weakened, and Ovac, who had lost the power of the red crystal, returned to his original appearance. At the same time, frost covered his skin layer by layer. |
7908|Just as the energy of the red crystal was about to completely disappear, suddenly the red light was blazing, and the scene in front of him was still the same, but Ovrac and Margarella were no longer visible. |
7909|Girl: "You really are here!" Just as you were puzzled by the current situation, a familiar voice came from behind. |
7910|Girl: "Every time you have something on your mind, you always come here!" After listening carefully, you recognize that this is Margaret's voice. |
7911|Juvenile: "Sister, you are here." A young man stood by the stream and looked at the water and the rainbow, and did not turn his head because someone called him. |
7912|The young man standing in the direction Margarella was going, although a lot younger, the young man was Ovark. |
7913|Margarella: "What's the matter, Ovarke, has anyone bullied you? Or did the research fail again?"|
7914|Ovark: "No...nothing...I'm okay." Looking at Ovark's low expression, you can clearly feel that his mood is very uncomfortable at the moment. |
7915|Seeing the free movement of Margarella and the emotional fluctuations in your mind, you perceive that everything in front of you is just a fragment of Ohuak's memory. |
7916|Margarella: "Remember? No matter who is in a bad mood and hides, we are always the first to find each other, and they are all here."
Ovarke: "Um..."|
7917|Margarella: "I still remember that you found this place when you were running away for the first time. If it weren't for your bracelet to fall in front, I couldn't find you at all."|
7918|Margarella: "There's more! After I found you, I realized that I was not running away, but lost my way, haha!"|
7919|Ovark: "Sister, didn't he get lost, it was Dad who found us in the end!"|
7920|Margarella: "This...it doesn't matter! Haha!"|
7921|Margarella: "It has become our secret base since then!"|
7922|Ovark: "Well...but you were in a bad mood later, and you hid here three times as many times as mine."|
7923|Margarella: "Ah, what are you doing with this!" Margarella smiled embarrassingly. |
7924|After seeing Margarella's warm smile, you feel that Ovack's frustration begins to improve, and you smile. |
7925|Margarella: "I will finally laugh, but in the future, it will not only belong to the two of us, but Dermot will also join us."|
7926|Hearing Dermot's name, Ovak's mood that had been getting better was immediately dropped to the bottom, and you could even feel a wave of extreme anger and pain. |
7927|Margarella: "With Dermot's vision and wisdom, coupled with your unique ideas and hard work, I believe you will be the greatest alchemist in the near future."|
7928|Margarella: "At that time, you won't have to live a life of tied hands and feet like now. I can go wherever I want. I must go to Holy Emblem City. I heard that it is very prosperous!"|
7929|Dermot: "Hahahaha, okay, okay! I'll take your sisters with you then!"|
7930|Dermott walked over with a smile, Ovark clenched his fists and was excited, but still smiled and agreed. |
7931|Margarella: "Dermot, you are here! We are talking about you!" Margarella greeted her intimately. |
7932|Margarella: "In the future, you two must work together. I believe that as long as you work together, you will succeed!" Margarella held the two hands together. |
7933|Dermot: "Let's work hard together!" Dermot showed a cordial smile, but Ovak was in a different mood at this time.It is very disgusting. |
7934|Dermott: "Well, Margaret, we have to go back, otherwise your work will be too late to finish."|
7935|Margarella: "Ah! I forgot if you don't tell me, Ovarke, my sister is leaving first, and I will look for you later!"|
7936|Nati: "You understand, don't think about any tricks, your sister is now completely under our control."|
7937|Aowak: "Despicable!" Aowak's resentment and powerlessness at the moment are clearly reflected in your mind. |
7938|Nati: "You have said these two words countless times since we found you, so what? Okay! Go back with me obediently!"|
7939|Nati: "It was because of our compassion that we asked you to come out and talk to Margarella before the clinical study. Don't waste any more time."|
7940|Nati: "Go, what are you doing? Do you think I am very patient? Believe it or not, I will kill your sister now."|
7941|When Ovark's memory image disappears, Margarella appears in front of you. |
7942|Margarella: "Ovark, I...uuu...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, my sister didn't mean it...it turns out that my sister said so many things that hurt you before."|
7943|The body of Margarella in front of her is transparent, with her feet floating, she slowly stopped crying after seeing you, and sensed your doubts through her spirit. |
7944|Margarella: "The power of the red crystal exploded at the moment of being sealed, let us break into each other's spirits, I only know that Ovac is..."|
7945|Margarella: "That's why I can talk to you mentally. Now, the power of the red crystal is about to disappear, and I should go too."|
7946|Margarella: "Son of Eternity, thank you very much for what you have done for our sister! I am glad to thank you in person before disappearing, goodbye!"|
7947|After the dialogue with Margarella Spirit is over, you slowly open your eyes and see the last piece of ice covering Ovac. |
7948|Aohuak laughed. Seeing that smile, you understand that all the Aohuake just now will be experienced with you. |
7949|Ovark: "Son of Eternity...thank you...remember to bury me and my sister...under the waterfall..."|

7966|Rebel researcher: "Oh my God! Someone has attacked the camp, come on! Don't let the important experimental weapons be destroyed!"|
7967|Rebel researcher: "What! Soldiers can't stop you? Although it's a little fuss, but now only Subject 44 can deal with you!"|
7968|Several scientific instruments appeared around and seemed to be still in operation. |

The huge roar in the distance: "Wow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!"|

7978|Kelier: "Everyone! The big thing is not good!" Kelier roared and ran over. |
7979|Kelier: "Everyone! Come and see." Kelier quickly ran to the position where Ulysses had fallen (70,290). |
7980|Kelier: "This is part of the mechanism of the second seal. I have to reassemble it, or Ulysses will stand up again!" After Kelier finished speaking, she started to work on her. |
7981|Rebel Research Director: "Don't even think about it, this is already our thing, Kelly, you traitor, you are going to accompany Aideen today."|
7982|Toledo Rebel General: "Pay attention to your identity, I am the one who gives orders!"

7985|O Ruofi: "Ah! Is the capacity full? ... Well, I think of it, I still have things, beautiful lady, let's eat together another day!"|
7986|Euruofei, the son of destruction, fled at a very fast speed. At this time, the entire ruins faintly vibrated, and there was a noisy sound of mechanical operation, which seemed to be the sound of the mechanism being activated. |

8063|Death Seal: Another one, you can also choose to wait for death over time|
8064|Lordland: No...absolutely impossible...I must find a way to get rid of you! |
8065|Magic Blade: Do you think you can get rid of us? We are you! To eradicate us is to kill yourself! what! what! Ha |
8066|Death Seal: Yeah! what! Probably only our master can choose to purify us or assimilate you! |
8067|Magic Blade: When you make a decision, let's find our brothers in the depths! |
8068|After the magic blade and the death seal have finished speaking, they disappear at the end of the abyss|
8069|Lordland: Master, wait, you have repelled the fire and dark demons under the magic blade and the death curse. I feel a new power fills my body|
8070|Magic Blade: Isn't this... the master? |
8071|Death Seal: Master, how come you...appear here|
8072|Magic Blade: It must be the fellow Lord Lance...|
8073|Death Seal: No matter what, don't think you can purify us...|
8074|Magic Blade: Brother, reveal our true power! |
8075|Magic Blade: Ah! what! Ah ah ah! ! ! ! ! !
Death mark: Ah! what! Ah ah ah! ! ! ! ! ! |
8076|Master, there are many dangers ahead, I will deliver the power of eternal spells to you and go ahead|
8077|Wait, Master, I will teach you the new power I gained|
8078|Magic Blade: This is our true strength! Plunge into the darkness! ! !
Death Mark: This is our true strength! Fall into death! ! ! |
8079|Needs the power of eternal dark prison to pass|
8080|Frodica: Today, we finally have the opportunity to compete with our three schools|
8081|Rolocco: Hmph, today's battle for the summit in this ancient tomb is bound to prove that we are the true king of swordsmanship|
8082|Stassen: Don't be arguing, nowadays the major swordsmanship is our two-edged genre|
8083|Frodica: Ha! I'm laughing so hard, whether it's the first sword or the second sword, you all come from our ancient life! |
8084|Roloke: You have a lot of work on your lips, and I'm worried that you can't even hold the sword|
8085|Statham: Humph!
Frodica: Humph! |
8086|The picture in front of you disappeared in an instant. It seems that this place was once the peak battle of the sword sects. Let's continue to get back the Taidao that Baixi wanted! |
8087|There is a special sense of oppression coming from the front, as if there is a force to keep you from approaching|
8088|The sword in his hand vibrated violently, as if it resonated with the thing ahead|
8089|There is a sound not far from the front, as if many swords are fighting with each other|
8090|Frodica: Who is the one to come! |
8091|The Soul of Roroco: Tomb Raider, never want to take my sword|
8092|Statham: Who sent you here! |
8093|Hahahaha, stupid coalition forces, let you taste the horror! |
8094|Hmm! Strength...I still need strength...Give me...Let's see...|
8095|Who dares to come forward and fight me! |
8096|The Soul of Frodica: Ha! what! what! The guy who can beat me can have my true biography|
8097|The Soul of Frodica: Put on my saber and defeat Roroko, the guy who made me defeat in the past|
8098|The Soul of Roroko: If I hadn't fought Frodika for too long, I wouldn't have lost to that guy|
8099|The Soul of Roroko: You have proven that you have the heritage of the ancient stream and the one sword stream, but only my saber can compete with that guy|
8100|The Soul of Stassen: The Battle of the Peaks that year, in order to compete for fame, the three of us exhausted our strengths to fight for life and death|
8101|The Soul of Frodica: Now it is this young man who has defeated us|
8102|The Soul of Loroko: The various genres of Samurai Soul will no longer be lost|
8103|The Soul of Frodica: Hahaha! Soul of Roroko: Hahaha!
The Soul of Starson: Hahaha! |

8173|Please follow the light spot instructions to catch up with the mysterious creature. |
8174|Please move to the position of the light spot and investigate the situation of the distant mysterious creature. |
8175|The mysterious creature said to the strange creature: "He is here, and the suffering will pass, are you ready?"|
8176|The strange creature responded with an unknown call. |
8177|The mysterious creature shouted: "Come out! I know you follow us!"|
8178|Please move forward to the position of the light spot. |
8179|The mysterious creature said to you: "I know you are full of doubts. This is why I attracted you to come. Have you seen this wall of sorrow? This is...|
8180|Mysterious Creatures: "Wait...Hmph! Are you coming..."|
8181|Sasha the beast Mars: "A foul creature, wants to infect this sacred place, and accept the baptism of the purifying flame!"|
8182|Sasha the beast Mars: "Who are you? Are you attracted by this filthy creature?"|
8183|You explain to Mars the Shasha the beast the reason why you came here. After listening to your narration, Mars the Shasha the beast thought about it. |
8184|Shaxia mythical beast Mars: "So, I am a beast guarding the Shaxia clan. My name is Mars. Although I don't know why these filthy creatures are interested in you, it must be related to their intrusion here twice.|
8185|The Shasha mythical beast Mars: "Since these filthy creatures are dead, then I think you can leave too, the Shasha tribe does not welcome outsiders!"|
8186|Mysterious creatures: "Hehe, we are not so simple to die."|
8187|Mysterious creature: "Fortunately, I thought that it was not so easy to hide it from you, and lost a substitute. Don't want to escape this account!"|
8188|The power of the explosion hits you and faints as soon as it gets dark in front of you. |
8189|Casoin, King of Toledo: "It seems that the unknown area seems to be the source of the plague, so send an army to explore it, and you should be able to get more clues."|
8190|Casoin, King of Toledo: "Oh  -   -  but to search such a large area, it will inevitably take a long time if there are not enough manpower. Most of the army will help prevent the spread of the plague, which is a bit difficult|
8191|Karon Baier, Prince Brad: "Why don't we send out an army together to explore, so that there will be enough manpower!"|
8192|The words of Prince Brad Caron Baier caused a burst of exclamation from the ministers present. |
8193|Prince Brad Carumbair: "After all, the plague is a serious threat to the lives of the people of the entire Central Continent. Every day it is delayed, more lives will die..."|
8194|Prince Brad Carumbaer: "The Valencia Federation can't sit back and watch this situation continue, presumably the same is true for the Kingdom of Toledo."|
8195|Kassoin of Toledo looked at the prince with surprise on his face and was silent for a while. |
8196|Casoin, King of Toledo: "Toledo and Valencia's united forces...and marching together with the enemy is really a bold plan..."|
8197|Casoin, King of Toledo: "Since the Valencia Federation does not care, I am not so small in Toledo, okay! I agree!"|
8198|You look at the plan put forward by the two leaders in front of you, and you feel excited. Maybe the dispute between the two countries will gradually disappear after this incident. |
8199|Rebecca Batllo: "No~~! What did you do!"|
8200|Rebecca Batllo: "Outsiders! What made you come to our residence to slaughter my children!"|
8201|You indicated to Rebecca that this was a last resort choice in order to pass through the Shasha walls. |
8202|Rebecca Batllo: "Ha! Sure enough, how can human selfishness be changed."|
8203|Rebecca Batllo: "In order to allow yourself to enter areas that are not allowed to approach, it doesn't matter to sacrifice the lives of others!"|
8204|Rebecca Batllo: "Take my anger, you have to pay for your actions!"|
8205|Please defeat Rebecca the Batllo monster together with the Grand Magister Rabis. |
8206|The Batllo sacred beast Rebecca, who was knocked down by the joint force, murmured to herself while supporting her severely injured body. |
8207|Rebecca Batllo: "Mars  -   -  I am sorry  -   -  I have not been able to protect our children  -   -  I cannot avenge the children|
8208|Grand Magister Rabis: "Oh~! My God~! I can feel the powerful beast energy buried in her body, just one step away, what are you waiting for?"|
8209|Please kill the badly wounded Batllo Rebecca to obtain the core of the beast. |
8210|Please go to the location designated by the mission and perform the magic ritual. |
8211|The Grand Magister Rabis began to sing magic spells that you don't understand. |
8212|With the singing of the Grand Magister's spell, the energy of the beast forms visible energy and begins to wash your body. |
8213|After a period of time, you can feel that the energy of the beast is fully integrated into the body. |
8214|Shaxia guard: "Princess!"|
8215|Please follow the Shaxia girl to continue moving forward. |
8216|Saxia girl: "Strange, how about the elders and other people?"|
8217|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan yelled: "Nini! Don't come over!"|
8218|Saxia girl Yanini: "Father! What happened?"|
8219|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Many people in the tribe have been infected with an unknown serious disease, and they are as weak as losing their strength, and the disease spreads very quickly, as long as they are close to those who have touched the disease, they will be infected."|
8220|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "So we concentrate these patients here, and the elders are thinking of ways to cure them."|
8221|You heard what the patriarch said, watched the Shaxia people lying on the ground carefully from a distance, and found that the symptoms were the same as those of the plague infection, and you thought of the Toledo soldiers in the Meranti jungle. |
8222|You shouted "Be careful!!! These patients..."|
8223|Sasha Patriarch Ya Nandan: "Protect the Elders!"|
8224|Please help Chief Shasha to repel the infected Shasha. |
8225|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "I want to contact the Lord immediately!"|
8226|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan started to cast the spell, but after a while there was no response. |
8227|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "What...what's going on..."|
8228|Except for you, all the Shaxia people present were dizzy. |
8229|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "The energy of the beast has disappeared. What happened to the Lord!"|
8230|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Guard! Come into the temple with me, I want to personally confirm the status of the god!"|
8231|Saxia Patriarch Yanandan looked at the people present, and suddenly his eyes stopped on you, with surprise on his face. |
8232|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Wait! Outsider...I can still feel the energy of the beast in you, can it be..."|
8233|There was a moment of silence, and the Shah patriarch Yanandan and the elder beside him looked at each other. |
8234|The elder murmured to himself: "Foolish Shaxia~When darkness falls~The messenger will appear~"|
8235|Elder: "Keep your eyes open~Neither male nor female~Neither god nor human~"|
8236|Elder: "It's definitely not the blood of Sha Xia ~ nurturing the soul of Sha Xia ~ full of bloody hands ~ the way of achieving light ~"|
8237|Saxia girl Yanini: "The prophecy of the Doomsday Scroll! Impossible! He killed our people, how could he be the messenger leading us to the light!"|
8238|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Nini, you are just deceiving yourself. You knew it from the time you saw him. Otherwise, you knew the rules of the clan, how could you bring an outsider here." |
8239|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Outsiders  -   -  come with me  -   -  God Lord and we all need your help."|
8240|Please follow Shaxia Patriarch Yanandan into the dungeon "Alulan Is". |
8241|Sasha mythical beast Mars: "Nandan? What happened, I am removing those filthy creatures."|
8242|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "God Lord, because the Shasha has lost the power you gave, I am worried about your safety."|
8243|Shaxia the beast Mars: "Oh~ It turns out that this is the case. It may be that the energy that I used just now is too large, which affects you."|
8244|Saxia mythical beast Mars: "Are these all tribesmen who have lost their power? Come close to me, and I will re-emerge your original energy."|
8245|"Don't get close to him!!" Just as everyone was approaching forward, suddenly there was a shout from the other side. |
8246|Mysterious creature: "He is a liar! Getting close to him will only make you look like me!"|
8247|Mysterious creatures: "Let you know the true face of this liar!!!"|
8248|After everyone watched the attack on the Shaxia beast Mars, their strange appearance exclaimed. |
8249|It seems that too much power has been used, and the mysterious creature becomes depressed. |
8250|Mysterious Creature: "The Son of Eternity -  -  - I will leave it to you..."|
8251|Mysterious creatures: "The messenger will appear  -  -  - Achieve the way of light -  -  - "|
8252|The mysterious creature fell to the ground and its appearance gradually changed. |
8253|Saxia girl Yanini: "Brother!"|
8254|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "How come  -  Lien led the Shasha warriors to experience the illusion? How could  -  -  - "|
8255|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan looked at the mysterious creature's corpse, turned his head and looked at the Shasha beast Mars roaring. |
8256|Shaxia Patriarch Yanandan: "You lie to me! You said that they will exercise in the illusion to gain stronger strength, so many years have passed, except for the occasional correspondence, I have never seen my son...|
8257|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "And now I see his body! And he was an ugly monster when he was alive!!!"|
8258|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Lien -  -  - There are so many good children -  -  - They are all the best boys in Shaxia -  -  - "|
8259|Sasha the beast Mars: "Damn reptile, my plan will soon succeed. Fortunately, you are here, and I can get more energy from you."|
8260|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "I'm fighting with you!!!"|
8261|Please help Patriarch Shasha to defeat the Shasha mythical beast Mars. |
8262|Shaxia's beast Mars: "No~~!! If I fail, don't you guys want to leave here!!"|
8263|Shaxia girl Yanini: "Dad!"|
8264|Sasha chief Yanandan: "Nini, I can't do it... The Shasha tribe depends on you to survive."|
8265|A Shaxia girl, Yanini, crying and said, "Without you, without brother, I can't do anything by myself."|
8266|Shaxia Patriarch Yanandan stretched out his right hand and patted Yanini on the shoulder tremblingly. |
8267|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "You are an excellent child. Although you are not a boy, Dad can imagine how you lead the crowd."|
8268|Sasha patriarch Yanandan: "Become the first matriarch of my Shasha  -  -  - "|
8269|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "It's a pity that Dad can't see you getting married. I don't know which man is so lucky..."|
8270|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Stay strong...Dad and brother will take care of you in the sky..."|
8271|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan: "Oh  -   -  I seem to see you wearing the patriarch's crown  -   -  how beautiful  -   - "|
8272|Sasha Patriarch Yanandan died after saying this. |
8273|Shaxia girl Yanini: "Woo -  -  - Papa -  - Woo -  -  - Papa -  -  - |
8274|Sasha the beast Mars: "Son of Eternity, thank you very much for stopping this evil conspiracy this time."|

8401|Lily: "You...you are Princess Amy? Why can you show up without power?"|
8402|Amy: "I am not very clear. After you broke through the barrier and came in, I felt my consciousness became clearer and clearer. When I opened my eyes, I was already standing outside the necklace."|
8403|Lily: "Consciousness...Well, I understand, probably this space is full of magical relationships, and the weak spirit body will show up after being absorbed."|
8404|A vigorous man roared in front of him: "Who is it! Who broke into the bloody secret realm!"|

8409|Lily: "Princess Amy! Danger! Get away from him!" Seeing that the situation is critical, Lily stepped forward and pulled Princess Amy aside. |
8410|Aaron: "The enemy... must be destroyed! I... I will destroy you all!"|
8411|It seems that the "Aaron" in front of him has lost his mind, and he must be defeated as soon as possible! |
8412|Aaron: "Uh... I, what's wrong with me... Why is my body sore?" Aaron patted his head lightly, trying to make himself sober. |
8413|Hearing Aaron's voice regaining her previous gentleness, Amy broke free from Lily's obstacle and ran to Aaron. |
8414|Aaron: "Ai... Amy! Why are you here! Could it be that you were also caught by the evil woman?"|
8415|Amy: "I'm waiting for you so hard! Why don't you come back all the time? Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh after a thousand years |
8416|Aaron: "It's okay! It's okay! It's okay! Don't cry, okay?" Aaron said tenderly. |
8417|Amy: "Well...I listen to you." Amy stopped crying, and the two hugged tightly, as if no outsiders were present. |
8418|Lily: "Hmm!" After a while, Lily's suggestive cough pulled the two from the world of the two back to reality. |
8419|Aaron: "Sorry, sorry! It's rude!" The two let go of each other and said embarrassingly.

8420|Aaron: "Great, you did it! I believe you can do it!" Aaron led Amy and Lily to catch up. |
8421|Aaron: "Now that the spell that seals the Scepter of Apocalypse has been destroyed, I think it's impossible for Julia to be undetected, we have to preemptively."|
8422|Suddenly, the entire space shook violently, and the evil magic that followed made people shiver, and the weak princess Amy fell to Aaron against the impact of the magic.
Amy: "Ah..."|
8423|Aaron: "Amy! No good, this is a sign that <Blood Conjurer> Julia is awakening. If you don't defeat her, Amy will..." Aaron hurriedly supported Amy and said worriedly. |
8424|Aaron: "Damn it! Damn it! What the hell should I do?"
- Go forward and discuss countermeasures with Aaron! |
8425|Julia: "I still wonder how my dear Aaron can break the seal. It turns out that a little mouse rushed to my heaven."|
8426|Julia: "After I solve you kid, I will find my dear Aaron again. This time I must let him know that he can't resist me!"|
8427|Julia: "No! Things shouldn't be like this! I don't want to leave here, I don't want to leave Ya..." Julia's voice and her body gradually disappeared. |

8431|Blamiyas: "You keep up with mechas, don't be snatched by the enemy!"|
8432|<Blood Conjurer> Julia returned to where the soul should go, and the magic here gradually dissipated as she disappeared. |
8433|When you were going back to find Lily and others, Aaron, Amy, and Lily just arrived here. |
8434|Aaron: "Thank you for helping me eliminate Julia. Now my soul is no longer bound by the blood, and I can go back with Amy!" Aaron looked at Amy and said excitedly. |
8435|Aaron: "What's the matter, Amy, why is your face so ugly? Is there any negative effect left by the blood spell?" Aaron said nervously. |
8436|Amy: "Aaron, I have no regrets if I can see you again, but...but...there is no time." Amy said, tears kept lingering behind. |
8437|Aaron: "Fool, now I am free from the bondage, and we have already met, we can always... be together forever!" Aaron seemed to realize something and said reluctantly. |
8438|Amy didn't say anything to continue, with a bitter smile on his face, Aaron was silent when he saw it, but he stepped forward and took Amy into his arms and gave her the most affectionate kiss. |
8439|Amy's figure gradually faded, and her body turned into a little glow to float towards the sky, she smiled, smiled happily, and finally disappeared with tears. |
8440|Amy: "Thank you... Aaron, if there is another life to come, I must still be your wife. Thank you too, Granny Lily and Son of Eternity!" Amy's voice came back from the sky. |
8441|Aaron: "Amy! Amy~~~~~~!" Aaron faces Amy's departure directionHe roared heartbreakingly, unable to extricate himself for a long time. |

8715|When you landed, Klady seemed to be afraid of something, and his body kept trembling. |
8716|Koala: "That...that is...what..." Koala's fearful voice caught your attention. |
8717|In front (463, 339), there is a huge dragon standing proudly, directing other kinsmen to fight. |
8718|Elan: "Huh? How can there be the smell of human beings, who is it?" The dragon's voice echoed the whole mountain without anger. |
8719|Elan: "Humans, this is not where you should come, hurry up! Hmm..." Out of the corner of the dragon's eyes he saw Koradi who was shaking. |
8720|Elan: "It's ridiculous, how can the dignified dragons stay with humans, child you stay, humans, I changed my mind, you must die!"
- Go forward and fight <Ancient Dragon> Yilan. |
8721|All the ancient dragons: "Hoo oh oh oh..." When you fight with Yilan, the battle ahead changes. |
8722|Elan: "Children! Damn it! Roar~" The dragon roared, abandoning you and Kola, and went straight to the original enemy. |
8723|A closer look, the enemy of the dragon is also the dragon family. Although the size of the dragon is very large, the number of each other is so large that it is difficult to separate the two sides in the battlefield. |
8724|There is an endless stream of dragons fighting with giant dragons, and the battle is getting more and more intense. Korah drives Koradi and leads you to take refuge in the air. |
8725|Elan: "Damn it, it is so, I just..." The dragon whispered, letting the enemy attack without blocking. |
8726|Elan: "Roar~" The dragon used all his strength to wipe out all the enemies in one go. |
8727|After the battle, the size of the dragon dropped sharply, lying on the ground and panting, and quickly stepped forward to ask what happened at this time. |
8728|Elan: "Human, what do you want to do...huh? This breath...you are the son of the blue crystal! And...the power of Torrias!" The dragon's hostile eyes turned into surprise at this moment.
- Go forward and talk to <Ancient Dragon> Yilan. |
8729|Together with Yilan, go to the top of Stormwind Mountain (461, 642) to defeat Baraka. |
8730|Baraka: "Honorable Lord Yilan, although you are in the dragon legend, you are old after all."|
8731|Baraka: "You who have lost most of your power now, do you still want to stop me?"|
8732|Elan: "Baraka, do you know what you are doing? This will only bring destruction!"|
8733|Baraka: "Huh! Only other small existences will be destroyed. Our dragons will still stand unshakable, no! We will become the rulers of the world!"|
8734|Elan: "You are crazy, wake up! This is not the mission of the dragon to survive!"|
8735|Baraka: "Enough! You timid coward, I don't want to listen to your preaching, if you must obstruct me, then speak with strength!"|
8736|Work together with Yilan to defeat Baraka! |
8737|Baraka: "Damn it! This is impossible! You! It's you!" Baraka stared at you with wide eyes. |
8738|Suddenly, a strange light shone on Baraka's body, and his power instantly recovered and greatly increased. |
8739|Baraka: "Die... all go to die!" Baraka's face was fierce, his mind has been swallowed by the power of expansion and transition. |
8740|Elan: "Oh! This is... the son of the blue crystal, this is not a force that belongs to this world, we must stop him!"|
8741|Ilan watched Baraka stay silent for a moment, and took a deep breath as if he had made a decision. |
8742|Elan: "Son of Blue Crystal, although we have not known each other for a long time, I believe in you! I believe in someone trusted by Torrias!"|
8743|When the meaning of Yilan's words is not yet clear, the dragon has turned into blazing white light flowing into your body, and you feel infinite power at this moment. |
8744|Elan: "Come on! Son of Blue Crystal, we have to stop this crazy dragon."|
8745|Baraka falls weakly, and the power that erodes him is gradually dissipating. |
8746|Baraka: "Master Yilan...and humans, thank you for your help, let me get rid of the control of evil forces...cough cough...cough cough cough cough cough cough..."|
8747|Baraka: "It looks like...my time has come... sorry... for causing you trouble..."|
8748|After Baraka barely finished speaking, he closed his eyes and waited for death to come, and the energy of life continued to flow away from him as light spots... |
8749|Elan: "This can't work, you have to be responsible for it!" Elan's voice came from your body. |
8750|The life energy that originally dissipated began to gather towards you, and Baraka's huge body gradually disappeared like Yilan. |
8751|After opening his eyes, all the dragons have disappeared, leaving only the horrified Toledo dragoon Korah and his mount Koradi. |
8752|Talk to Korah (475,632) and leave this place together. |
8753|Please equip the holy sword Ollison, he can guide the dark king of chaos out! |
